/**
 * What bounds a relay socket (docs/specs/relay.md -> "Routing").
 *
 * The frame gates and routing rules live in `relay.test.mjs`; these are the
 * resource bounds around them — how many Client sockets exist, how large a
 * frame may be before any guard runs, and the two reasons a socket that passed
 * the upgrade is closed afterwards. The upgrade check runs exactly once, which
 * is why the sweep exists at all.

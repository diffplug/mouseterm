/**
 * The relay, hostile: what an operator who records, drops, reorders,
 * duplicates, modifies, and invents frames can actually obtain
 * (docs/specs/remote-security-model.md -> Burrow bounds, Security Guarantees).
 *
 * `e2e-relay.test.mjs` drives the same two peers through the *honest* relay;
 * this file replaces it with one that is trying, so the assertions are about
 * what stays impossible rather than what still works. The relay wraps the real
 * `RelayHub` — its routing is the shipped routing — and the last case removes
 * its own `ct`/`id`/shape guards to show they are defense in depth: the Burrow
 * runs the same guard on arrival and its bounds do not move.
 *
 * HTTP is a real Relay, because the presence proofs go through the real
 * `/api/reauth/*` routes; only the relay is in memory.

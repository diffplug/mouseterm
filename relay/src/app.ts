 *   `'self'`, whose ws/wss coverage browsers have disagreed about. It is the
 *   configured origin with the scheme swapped, so it can only ever be this
 *   deployment's own relay.
 * * `img-src` also admits `data:` and `blob:`, `media-src` `blob:` — images and

 *
 * `script-src` needs no *script* exception: the build emits no inline script

 * against the built output. Its one addition is `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, which

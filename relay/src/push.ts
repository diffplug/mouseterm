/**
 * Web Push delivery (docs/specs/alert.md -> Push notifications, docs/specs/relay.md).
 *
 * The relay cannot do this job: it routes between two live sockets and answers
 * "burrow <id> is offline" when a peer is missing. A push has to reach a phone
 * whose app is backgrounded or closed, which means handing the payload to the
 * platform's push service (APNs for Safari, FCM for Chrome) and letting it do
 * the waking.
 *
 * `web-push` carries RFC 8291 payload encryption (ECDH -> HKDF -> AES-128-GCM
 * with the aes128gcm framing) and the RFC 8292 VAPID JWT. Both are worth taking
 * a dependency for rather than hand-rolling: a subtly wrong HKDF info string
 * produces a push the phone silently fails to decrypt, with no error anywhere
 * we can see.
 *
 * Delivery is behind the {@link PushSender} seam so the send route can be
 * tested without a real push service, the same reason `AppConfig` takes an
 * injectable clock.

No project-specific tend preferences yet beyond the notes below. Add guidance here as needed — this file is loaded by tend workflows alongside AGENTS.md.

## Filing issues in other repos

When asking permission to file an issue upstream (e.g. at `max-sixty/tend`), do **not** include the standing-exception offer ("I can treat this target as file-directly going forward"). nedtwigg wants to keep approving each cross-repo issue individually — keep asking each time, and skip the offer. ([diffplug/dormouse#168](https://github.com/diffplug/dormouse/issues/168#issuecomment-4836133002))

## The Chromatic `UI Tests` check is human-gated — don't wait it out in a gated-approval poll

After approving a visually-changing PR the approval is gated, so the CI Monitoring poll runs to dismiss-on-red. One status context — **`UI Tests`** (Chromatic, `target_url` → `chromatic.com/build...`) — stays `PENDING` for the entire poll because Chromatic holds it open until a maintainer accepts or rejects the visual diffs in the Chromatic UI; it does **not** auto-terminalize in-session. Its sibling **`Storybook Publish`** (also Chromatic) *does* terminalize normally, so this applies only to `UI Tests`.

When `UI Tests` is the only non-terminal check and every automated check is green (Build & Test, Visual Regression Tests, verify, Standalone Smoketest, Cloudflare Pages, Storybook Publish), treat it as human-gated: stop polling, confirm nothing flipped to FAILURE, and keep the approval standing — don't wait out the poll cap. Polling it to the cap wastes ~9–17 job-minutes per visually-changing PR with no added signal. (Observed on #203, #289, #317.)

## A restart starts clean — don't carry a superseded PR's findings forward

Long-running work here is often closed and reopened as a fresh PR ("Supersedes #N"), and that restart is deliberate — nedtwigg: *"When I start over, I usually **want** to start over. The original conversation grew too unfocused and out of hand."* So review the successor on its own terms: don't fetch the predecessor's bot comments and reviews in order to re-raise findings from them, and don't treat a finding dropped that way as a gap in the review machinery. Carrying the closed thread's context forward is the thing the restart was for.

Proposed as an overlay note and rejected in [#421](https://github.com/diffplug/dormouse/pull/421#issuecomment-5361239323). The underlying incident (#398 → #416, where three findings written up as #398 closed mid-review went unre-raised) is easy to re-derive from session logs — a `review-runs`/`review-reviewers` sweep that rediscovers it should not re-file it here or upstream at `max-sixty/tend`.

## Settled upstream rulings — don't re-file

Before a `review-runs`/`review-reviewers` sweep flags a tend behavior as waste or files it upstream, check this list — these were already raised and ruled on, so re-filing burns a session and spams upstream:

- **`tend-review` silently running a full review on the bot's own PRs is intended, not waste.** The diff read *is* the review — it catches lint failures and edge cases even though self-approval is impossible, so a silent exit means the review ran and found nothing to post. Ruled intended behavior by the upstream owner in [max-sixty/tend#607](https://github.com/max-sixty/tend/issues/607) (closed as intended, same ruling as tend#212/#154). Do not treat self-review-of-bot-PRs no-ops as cost waste and do not re-file. (The companion `tend-mention` no-op on undirected bot comments, [tend#606](https://github.com/max-sixty/tend/issues/606), was *fixed* upstream — that one is resolved, not rejected.)

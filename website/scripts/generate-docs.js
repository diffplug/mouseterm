 * Build-time codegen for the public documentation pages.

 * Reads the canonical sources, parses them with the in-repo Markdown parser,

 * Dor implementation modules (they use Node APIs) or reads Markdown at runtime
 * — everything it needs is in the generated JSON, split per document so
 * /docs/dor does not ship the agent skill along with it.
 *
 * The guide half of this pipeline has no page of its own right now (see
 * docs/specs/website-docs.md -> Canonical product guide). It is kept whole and
 * still runs on every build, because the guide's media sync is what puts
 * vscode-ext/images/ on dormouse.sh, where the packaged Marketplace listing
 * loads its images from, and because the guide data is what a future page
 * would render.
 *
 * Wired into website `predev` / `pretest` / `prebuild`, mirroring
 * generate-changelog.js.

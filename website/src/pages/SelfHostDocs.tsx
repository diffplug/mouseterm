/**
 * `/docs/self-host` — the runbook half of SELF_HOST.md.
 *
 * The file is canonical in the repository: an assistant reads it there to walk
 * someone through the install, and `scripts/deploy-lint.mjs` audits the
 * Installer contract at the end of it against `deploy/local/`. The generator's
 * delta withholds that contract and the assistant-directed sections; see
 * docs/specs/website-docs.md -> `/docs/self-host` runbook.
 *
 * The security model above the runbook is the security spec's own rows and
 * bullets for this audience, rendered from `docs.security.json` rather than
 * restated here — docs/specs/website-docs.md -> `/docs/security` spec.

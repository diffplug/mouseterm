/**
 * `/docs/security` — docs/specs/security.md, every section of it.
 *
 * The file is canonical in `docs/specs/`: it is a spec, budgeted by
 * `scripts/spec-lint.mjs` and read by the nightly audit that runs against it.
 * The generator's delta withholds only the `#` title and the front matter; see
 * docs/specs/website-docs.md -> `/docs/security` spec. The page renders
 * `pageBlocks`, so the guarantees table and the two lists carry this audience's
 * entries only — the other two are on `/docs/self-host` and `/supply-chain`,
 * and the spec file on GitHub is where every entry appears together.

/**
 * The docs pages' theme picker, and the prompt that points a reader at it.
 *
 * The picker is the same `compact` ThemePicker the Pocket playground pages
 * use, for the same reason: these pages have no baseboard, so there is no
 * Settings dialog to put it in (docs/specs/theme.md -> Where the user picks a
 * theme).
 *
 * Two placements, because the docs have two shapes. Wide screens float it
 * bottom right, clear of the rail, opening upward. Narrow screens have a
 * sticky bar already naming the section, so it sits at the end of that line
 * and opens downward rather than adding a second floating control to a small
 * viewport.

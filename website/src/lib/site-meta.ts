/**
 * The head tags that differ per page: title, description, canonical, and the
 * social cards that mirror them.
 *
 * One helper, because React Router renders only the deepest route's `meta` —
 * its tags "are not rendered on descendant routes" — so a page that wants its
 * own title replaces the whole set rather than merging with the root's. Every
 * page therefore builds its tags here, and a page with nothing of its own
 * inherits the root route's call.
 *
 * **Never** hardcode one of these in `root.tsx`'s `<head>`. A tag written there
 * is emitted before `<Meta />`, so a page that set its own title shipped two
 * `<title>` elements and every crawler read the first — the homepage's. Pinned
 * by `checkPageHeadTags` in scripts/public-docs-lint.mjs.

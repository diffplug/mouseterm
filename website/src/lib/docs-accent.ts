/**
 * The docs pages' link colour, derived from the theme the reader picked.
 *
 * **Never** take it from `--vscode-textLink-foreground`. No bundled theme
 * defines `textLink.foreground`, so that variable always resolves to the
 * colour registry's default for the theme's *kind* — one blue on every dark
 * theme, one on every light one — and links looked identical whichever theme
 * was chosen. Every theme does carry an `accent`, which is the colour a reader
 * recognises it by.
 *
 * **Must** correct that accent for contrast before using it as body text.
 * Taken raw, 7 of the 11 bundled accents fall below WCAG AA against their own
 * background and four carry alpha, so using them directly would undo the
 * contrast work that moved these links off brand caramel in the first place.
 *
 * Correction walks the accent toward whichever of white or black contrasts
 * more with the background, stopping at the first step that clears the
 * threshold, so a theme keeps as much of its accent as contrast allows.
 * Pinned by
 * `website/src/lib/docs-accent.test.ts`, which checks every bundled theme.

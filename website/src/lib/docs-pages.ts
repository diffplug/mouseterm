/**
 * Every page in the docs section, in the order the left rail lists them.
 *
 * One owner for "which pages exist and how they are ordered". The route table,
 * the prerender list, the rail, its prev/next links, and
 * `scripts/public-docs-lint.mjs` all derive from this, because a page added to
 * one of those and missed in another ships unreachable, unrendered, or
 * unchecked.
 *
 * The changelog and the supply chain live here too. They are not generated
 * from Markdown like the four references, but a reader meets them the same
 * way — long-form material reached from the rail rather than from the
 * marketing nav. The hosted-services preview is authored marketing, but
 * shares that reading surface so it sits beside the self-host alternative.
 *
 * **Must stay erasable-syntax TypeScript with no imports.**
 * `scripts/public-docs-lint.mjs` imports this module directly and relies on
 * Node's type stripping, which erases types but resolves nothing: an
 * extensionless specifier, a path alias, or a browser-only import here fails
 * `pnpm test` at its first step, far from whatever change caused it.
 *
 * See docs/specs/website-docs.md -> Reference page chrome.

   * an editor extension, so the guide carries no self-host obligation.
   *
   * `homepage` is the on-site obligation: the marketing page is the one most
   * able to strand a reference, so a page reachable from the rail alone must
   * say so by omitting it. The changelog is the deliberate omission — readers
   * reach it from the rail and from the standalone updater's deep link, and
   * the homepage sells the product rather than its release history.

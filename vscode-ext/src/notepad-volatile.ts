/**
 * The extension host's volatile notepad mirror (`docs/specs/notepad.md` →
 * Archive and Lifecycle).
 *
 * VS Code can destroy a webview without asking — an editor tab closed, a window
 * gone — so the close coordinator that normally archives a Surface's notes may
 * never run. Every webview therefore mirrors its live notes here, and a teardown
 * archives from the mirror instead.
 *
 * **Memory only, never a file.** Module state is cleared by an extension restart
 * by construction, which is the point: this is not a draft store, it is the
 * bridge across one disposal. It hydrates exactly one path — a live resume, a
 * webview re-resolved over PTYs this extension host still owns — never a cold
 * restore.

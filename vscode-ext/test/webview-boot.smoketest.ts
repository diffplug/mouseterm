/**
 * Does the built webview actually boot?
 *
 * Every other test in this directory checks a transform in isolation, including
 * `webview-html.test.ts`, which pins the CSP contract against a *fixture* of
 * Vite's output. A fixture cannot notice that Vite started emitting a shape
 * nobody anticipated — which is exactly how the webview shipped blank for
 * thirteen days (`docs/specs/vscode.md` → "CSP policy"). Only running the real
 * bundle under the real policy in a real engine closes that gap, because CSP
 * enforcement is the thing under test and no amount of string inspection
 * substitutes for it. jsdom is not an option: it does not enforce CSP at all.
 *
 * Deliberately shallow. It asserts the app mounts and the policy blocked
 * nothing — not what the UI looks like, which is Storybook's and Chromatic's
 * job.

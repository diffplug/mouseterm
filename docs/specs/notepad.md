## Model

A notepad is one ordered list of notes per Surface, held in renderer memory for that Surface's life and opened from its header or its Door.

- **A note is plain text or a captured terminal excerpt** (`NoteContent`), and nothing else.
- **A run keeps bold, italic, foreground, and background, and nothing else.** Colors are normalized lowercase `#rrggbb`; a missing color means the theme default, so an excerpt stays theme-adaptive. **Underline, dim, blink, strike-through, and hyperlinks are dropped at capture**, never later.
- **A note's source pin is runtime-only.** `RuntimeTerminalSource` holds live xterm markers, so `ArchivedNote` is `LiveNote` minus that field and no marker ever reaches a store.
- **A closure appends one `ArchiveBatch` per Surface** — `id`, `closedAt`, `surfaceTitle`, `surfaceKind`, `cwd`, and the notes in creation order.
- **`ArchiveBatch.cwd` is required and nullable.** It is the whole canonical `CwdState` snapshotted before teardown — path, URI, host, path kind, source, observation time — or `null` for a browser Surface and a terminal that never reported one. **Never persist a preformatted CWD label beside it**; the Archive renders path and remote host through `cwdDisplay`.
- **A batch id is remembered per Surface across its closure attempts and forgotten once one lands**, and **every attempt deletes and re-appends that id in one mutation**, so an attempt that landed and *then* reported failure is replaced by the next, carrying the edits, additions, and deletions made in between. **`closedAt` is minted per attempt.**
- **A mutation applies its deletes before its appends**, which is what makes that pair a replacement. Appends stay idempotent by batch and note id — an already-stored note is dropped from an appended batch and a batch left empty is skipped — and deleting something already gone is a no-op.

## Helper terminals

- **Must share the parent Surface's notepad while a terminal is a Helper**, capturing into the parent's ordered list and editing that same list from the Helper's notepad button.
- **Never create source pins for Helper captures or show pin actions in the Helper's notepad view**, including for notes captured by the parent. Parent pins remain usable from the parent's ordinary notepad view.
- **Must retain shared notes on Helper hide, refresh, Reset, and promotion.** Promotion leaves existing notes with the parent; the promoted Session starts with an empty independent notepad and ordinary capture behavior.
- **Must archive shared notes once under the parent on parent closure**, using the parent's metadata and closing freeze. Helper disposal creates no archive batch.

Tests: `lib/src/lib/notepad/capture.test.ts`, `lib/src/components/NotepadPanel.test.tsx`, `lib/src/components/Wall.test.tsx`.

## The archive port

`PlatformAdapter.notepadArchive` is the whole host surface of the archive.

- **A host stores bytes and names their version; the shared layer owns the shape.** `load()` returns `{ raw, revision }` or `null` (nothing ever archived); `save(archive, baseRevision)` replaces the stored archive only while it is still at that revision, answering `'conflict'` otherwise.
- **Every mutation is a compare-and-swap, retried on conflict** — load, validate, apply, save against the revision just read — bounded at `MAX_SAVE_ATTEMPTS` before it reports the archive busy (rationale).
- **One mutation queue per webview.** Two Surfaces closing together would otherwise read one revision and lose a batch to the other's conflict.
- **A host with no notepad omits the port.** Pocket does, and the header icon, Door button, selection-popup action, and Settings entry are hidden with it.
- **One store per host, never shared.** The standalone and VS Code archives must never discover, import, or synchronize each other's data.
- **A failed archive rejects; it never resolves as if the write landed.** Closure paths turn that rejection into their failure UI rather than dropping notes.

Standalone stores a file ([Standalone quit](#standalone-quit)), VS Code a shared file ([VS Code lifecycle](#vs-code-lifecycle)), the demo hosts plain memory cleared by a page reload.

## Capture

"Add to notepad" captures a finalized Dormouse selection as a rich note on the Surface holding it.

- **Join soft-wrapped rows and keep every hard break.** A row is soft-wrapped when the row *following* it reports xterm's `isWrapped`; a block selection is a rectangular slab, so every one of its rows ends hard. **Trailing whitespace is trimmed only on a row that ends hard** — a soft-wrapped row is full by definition.
- **Capture is not Copy Rewrapped**: no paragraph joining and no box-drawing stripping (`docs/specs/mouse-and-clipboard.md` §4.1.2; rationale).
- **Retain the raw selected text separately.** `extractSelectionText` over the same selection is the pin's validation key, read from the buffer rather than rebuilt from the runs.
- **Colors record what xterm drew.** Walk buffer cells over the normalized selection, skip width-zero continuation cells, emit a wide character once, resolve palette and RGB colors, swap inverse ones to explicit values, and merge adjacent runs of identical styling. **Bold text on palette entries 0–7 resolves to the bright entry while `drawBoldTextInBrightColors` is on.** Entries 0–15 come from the live theme, 16–255 from xterm's computed table.
- **An alternate-buffer capture gets no pin.** A full-screen program rewrites its grid in place, so there is nothing stable to point at.
- **A capture flashes in place and dismisses the selection; it never opens the notepad.**

## Source links

A pin is the runtime link from a captured note back to the scrollback it came from.

- **Pin an ordinary Session's normal-buffer capture with two xterm markers plus the normalized endpoint columns and the raw text.** Markers ride the buffer as it scrolls; the columns and text rebuild and prove the range.
- Clicking a pin runs five steps: close the notepad; reattach a minimized Surface; resolve both markers and rebuild the range from their current lines and the stored columns; read it back and compare **exactly** with the captured raw text; on success scroll it into view and restore the Dormouse selection, outline and finalized popup included, plus the selection baseline a drag would leave — render-tick invalidation applies to a restored selection as to a dragged one.
- **Column restoration after a resize is best effort**; the raw-text equality is what prevents navigating to the wrong output. Trimmed scrollback is discovered only when a pin is used.
- **While the alternate buffer is active a pin is temporarily unavailable and kept** — the markers belong to the normal buffer and resolve again once the program exits; the notepad says to exit it.
- **Every other pin failure removes the pin and keeps the note.** Disposed markers, rows out of range, and a text mismatch all report that the source is no longer available, the notepad kept or reopened to say so.
- **Disposing or replacing a terminal instance drops its pins immediately**, notes untouched — a marker belongs to one xterm instance.
- **Pins never affect ordering and are not user-controlled favorites.**

## Notepad UI

**The header notepad icon sits after the mouse-override icon and before the split controls** (`docs/specs/layout.md` → "Pane header"), filled while the Surface has notes and regular otherwise. **At the minimal tier an empty notepad yields its space to the title; one with notes stays**, so notes are never invisible.

- **The attached notepad is a panel in the top-right of the Surface body, three quarters of it wide and tall.** It closes on its close control, Escape, or an outside click.
- **Only one Surface notepad is open per Wall.** The store holds a single open id, and opening a Door's popover closes the attached panel.
- **An open notepad owns the keyboard.** It is a `role="dialog"` with a focus trap, takes a lease on the Wall's dialog keyboard so command-mode dispatch stands down, and stops key and mouse events from reaching the Surface under it — a live browser pane's key forwarder included.
- **A Door is a wrapper carrying `data-door-id` with one or two buttons.** The wrapper is what the selection ring and the baseboard fitting measure; the title button keeps click-to-reattach and the drag press, the notepad button does neither. **A minimized Surface with no notes gets no notepad button.**
- **The Door popover opens above its Door, edge-clamped, capped at 30rem wide and 75% of the Wall height. Opening it never reattaches the Surface** — only following a pin from it does.

Editing and copying:

- **Notes stay in creation order, never re-sorted.** Add New appends an empty plain note at the bottom and focuses it; **an untouched empty note is pruned on blur or on panel close**.
- **Moving the caret through a rich note never converts it.** Conversion hangs off the one event that names the edit: **the first content mutation — typing, deletion, cut, or paste — converts the whole note to plain text and applies the edit atomically.** **Paste inserts the plain flavor only.**
- **An IME composition converts on `compositionend`, with the composed text** — `insertCompositionText` is not cancelable, so it is the one edit the browser writes into the rich DOM first.
- **Rich runs render as escaped spans in a whitespace-preserving container**, never as injected HTML.
- **Copy always writes `text/plain`.** A terminal note adds a `text/html` flavor built only from escaped text and the four supported attributes — never by serializing rendered DOM. **Anything the rich clipboard refuses falls back to the plain-text write**, best effort by contract.

The popup's third action and the `⌘N` / `Ctrl+N` chord belong to `docs/specs/mouse-and-clipboard.md` §4.1 and §4.2. Two rules are the notepad's own: **intercept the chord only while that terminal has a finalized Dormouse selection**, so with none it reaches the program unchanged; and **a host whose browser reserves the chord shows no shortcut and binds none**, gated by `browserReservesNotepadChord`, which the website demo and the standalone browser-dev harness set (rationale). Source of truth: `isNotepadChordBound` in `lib/src/lib/notepad/capture.ts`, `lib/src/components/SelectionPopup.tsx`.

## Archive

A **Notepad archive** entry in Settings replaces that dialog's content with a roomier Archive view carrying a Back to Settings action. **The entry is hidden where the host has no archive port.**

- **Must re-read storage on every Archive opening**, ordering reads with mutations; tested in `lib/src/lib/notepad/archive-service.test.ts`.
- **Batches show newest first, notes in their original order within each batch.** A batch header carries its Surface title, kind, closure time, and CWD when present.
- **An archived note offers Copy and Delete only** — no editing and no pin, through the same clipboard exporter live notes use.
- **Deletions are staged while the view is open.** A delete hides its target with no confirmation, a batch left with nothing visible goes with it, and the first deletion raises "Deletion is irreversible once this window closes." with an **Undo** restoring everything staged since the view opened.
- **Back, Escape, and the close control commit the staged set as one mutation before leaving. A failed commit keeps the view open with its staged set intact and shows the error**; pressing the same control again is the retry.
- **Stored data that fails validation is reported as unreadable and never silently replaced.** Every append fails meanwhile, and closures take the failure path in [Closure](#closure). **Exactly one user-initiated recovery moves the stored data aside — never deletes it — and starts an empty archive** (rationale).
- **Must revalidate a VS Code recovery inside the storage transaction**; a now-valid or absent archive stays untouched (`vscode-ext/test/notepad-archive-store.test.ts`).
- **An unknown field anywhere in stored data fails validation**, because every mutation rewrites the whole archive, so a field this build does not know would be erased on the next save (rationale).
- **Archived entries stay until explicitly deleted.** No age limit and no count limit.

## Closure

**Every user-visible permanent Surface closure routes through the close coordinator**, which builds stable-id batches from whatever notes exist and appends them in one mutation *before* teardown. Routed: the header kill button, keyboard kills both confirmed and on the untouched fast path, `dor kill`, the Door-restore kill path, and controlled application quit. **A multi-Surface closure appends every batch in one mutation**, and a closure with no notes writes nothing — **unless an earlier attempt of that Surface landed a batch, which the same mutation then deletes**, its notes having been deleted after the user was told none were stored.

**A Surface's notes are frozen from the moment its closure snapshots them until the write settles** — adds, edits, and deletes are refused, a refused capture releases its own markers, and the panel renders read-only behind an "Archiving notes…" line — so nothing taken during the write can be archived stale or dropped unarchived by the forget step (rationale). The freeze is counted, so overlapping closures of one Surface thaw it once. **Empty plain notes are never archived**: an untouched Add New still on screen when the kill lands is not a note, and a Surface holding only those closes as if it held none.

**A terminal Surface's process CWD is refreshed immediately before its batch is built** — every such Surface at once, bounded as one batch at `PROCESS_CWD_REFRESH_MS`, a timeout, refusal, or synchronous lookup error keeping whatever the Session last reported, and **never overriding, or even asking about, a CWD the shell integration reported** — so a shell with no CWD escapes still archives where it was, and no Surface pays for an answer that would be discarded.

**The immediate-teardown primitive is reachable only once the archive question is settled, or from a Surface that cannot have taken a note**: `closeSurface` after its append lands or its Close anyway answer discards the notes, and `dor ensure`'s integration-timeout teardown of the throwaway split it just created.

**Must check Helper work before archiving and again before teardown.** If work begins during the write, retain the live notes and pending batch for replacement on retry. The parent's notes stay frozen through both checks. Close anyway discards notes only after the same Helper guard accepts closure.

On a failed archive:

- **A blockable closure keeps the Surface open** behind a pane-anchored error offering **Keep open** (default) and **Close anyway**, which discards that Surface's notes; without the escape an unwritable archive would make every Surface unclosable. **Close anyway and Quit anyway write nothing**: a batch an earlier attempt landed before reporting failure stays in the Archive rather than risking a second refused write.
- **Refused closures queue, oldest first, one prompt on screen**, so a second refusal cannot orphan the Surface waiting on the first; a Surface already queued has its message replaced.
- **`dor kill` returns an error, raises no prompt, and the Surface stays** — the caller is a command, not someone looking at the Wall.
- **An aborted `AbortSignal` suppresses the forget step.** The mutation still finishes, but the live notes stay, so a caller that stopped waiting cannot empty a notepad behind the user; a later close re-archives them once.

**An in-place replacement keeps the notepad instead of archiving it.** Renderer swaps, browser/terminal mode changes, and shell replacement each mint a new Surface id, so the notes migrate with the ref wherever `transferSurfaceRef` runs; pins into the disposed terminal are dropped on the way.

Reserved: Workspace and Window closure has no live code path today (`closeWorkspace` has only test callers and the workspaces flag is dormant), so nothing is wired to it; routing it through the coordinator belongs to the **workspaces-rollout** scope.

## Standalone quit

**Archiving is a gate step before teardown**: after the running-work confirmation, or immediately on an all-idle quit, and **before the first `quit_progress`** (`docs/specs/standalone.md` → "Quit flow"; rationale). **It is bounded at 3 s.**

- **A failure or timeout leaves the quit pending in Rust**, whose phase-2 wait is unbounded for exactly this (`docs/specs/standalone.md` → "Quit flow"), and the dialog shows the error with **Cancel** (default) and **Quit anyway**, which discards the notes. **Only Cancel calls `quit_cancel`**: Quit anyway must reach teardown with the watchdog still armed.
- **A timeout aborts the archive it stopped waiting for** ([Closure](#closure)).
- **Must include Surfaces with pending batch IDs even after their last note is deleted**, both when archiving and discarding on Quit anyway; pinned by `standalone/src/quit-notepad.test.ts`.
- **Teardown's own rule is untouched**: once teardown begins, no failing step prevents exit.

The store is `<app_data_dir>/notepad-archive-v1.json`, **a sibling of `sessions/`, never inside it** — a Surface's notes outlive the window whose closure archived them, so they must not ride the per-window session blob or be swept by `clear_session`. **It is written owner-only and atomically through the same `write_file_atomically` the session snapshot uses** (`docs/specs/security-local.md` → "Persisted state"). **The revision is a hash of the stored bytes, and every load, save and reset holds an exclusive lock on the sidecar `notepad-archive-v1.lock`** — a second Dormouse sharing `app_data_dir()`, a dev build beside the installed app, then conflicts instead of overwriting batches it never read. **Recovery renames it to `notepad-archive-v1.unreadable-<unix-millis>.json` beside the original**, disambiguating rather than overwriting an earlier quarantine; only a temp file a crash left behind is dropped.

## VS Code lifecycle

**Must store the archive in `<globalStorageUri>/notepad-archive.json`**, atomically replaced with mode `0600` (Windows inherits VS Code's directory ACL). **Must serialize reads, saves, recovery, and teardown mutations across extension hosts**, checking the shared revision under the filesystem lock; pinned by `vscode-ext/test/notepad-archive-file.test.ts`. **Must migrate `globalState` key `dormouse.notepadArchive.v1` only when the file is absent**, retaining a tombstone after recovery so stale caches cannot resurrect it. **Never register the legacy key for Settings Sync.** Recovery preserves the file in a unique sibling quarantine. (rationale)

VS Code can destroy a webview without asking, so the close coordinator may never run. **Every webview therefore mirrors its live notes into extension-host memory**, and a teardown archives from that mirror instead.

- **The mirror holds what a close would archive minus the markers** — notes, Surface title, kind and CWD, plus its pending batch id, each terminal Surface's PTY id, and any archive deletions an open Archive view has staged. **The PTY id is mirror-only and never reaches a batch.**
- **Must mirror pending batch identity before saving and retain it after the last note is deleted.** Teardown deletes and re-appends that batch; live resume restores its identity. Pinned by `vscode-ext/test/notepad-archive-store.test.ts` and `lib/src/lib/notepad/notepad-store.test.ts`.
- **A teardown refreshes the mirror's process CWDs while the PTYs are alive** — bounded, and never overriding an integration-reported one — which on an editor-panel disposal is what makes the kill wait for the archive write, and in `deactivate()` puts it ahead of the session flush.
- **The mirror is memory only, never written to disk, and cleared by an extension restart.** It is a bridge across one disposal, not a draft store.
- **The mirror is sanitized on the way in**, round-tripped through the archive validator, because a teardown writes it verbatim with no webview left to ask.
- **Editor-panel disposal (`killOnDispose: true`) and `deactivate()` archive their mirrored notes, best effort**, draining what they take so `deactivate()` cannot write a panel's notes again under a fresh batch id. In `deactivate()` the step sits between the recovery capture and the session flush, bounded (`docs/specs/vscode.md` → "Serialization and restore").
- **Every router disposal commits and drains that router's staged archive deletions, best effort** — they were promised irreversible once this window closed, and the webview *is* the window. **A live resume is therefore never handed a pending deletion**; `hydrateNotepadFromVolatile` ignores the field.
- **A `WebviewView` disposal is not a closure.** Its PTYs stay alive, so only its *notes* stay in the mirror for the next resolve.
- **External tab or window destruction cannot reliably be blocked**, so a storage failure or a forced termination may lose those notes. **Never add a persistent draft mirror to address it.**

## Live resume

**The mirror hydrates exactly one path, a live resume** — a webview re-resolved in the same extension host, including browser-only views with no PTYs. It rides the boot payload beside the recovery commands, claimed by the same pane ids, and **is consumed exactly once**: a second read would be a cold restore's, and **a cold restore must never hydrate live notes** (rationale). An editor panel and an extension restart supply `null`. **Must hydrate browser-only layouts from a present same-host mirror even when the PTY list is empty**, pinned by `lib/src/lib/reconnect.test.ts`.

**Hydration fills only live Surfaces holding no notes yet**, and restores no pins — the markers died with the previous webview's xterm instances.

**Live notes must never enter a restoration path**: not a session snapshot, not Lath persistence, not `localStorage`, not VS Code webview or workspace state. The volatile mirror is the single exception, and only here.

## Security

**Captured terminal excerpts, their style data, the Surface title and kind, and the CWD persist in the archive; ordinary scrollback still persists nowhere** (`docs/specs/security-local.md` → "Persisted state"). An excerpt reaches disk only because the user added it to a notepad and then closed that Surface.

# Alert — Rationale

> Informative companion to [alert.md](alert.md): the evidence, worked failure cases, and dead-approach history behind its rules, keyed by that spec's headings (AGENTS.md → "What, not why"). Nothing here is normative.

## Public State

**Why the detector outranks the command-exit arm.** A watched command is by definition running, so a WATCHING Session is almost always also command-exit armed; ranking the arm first would mask the detector's busy/quiet states for the whole run, and the detector's state is the one derived from real output.

## Completion events

**Why nothing is decided at the point of detection.** Dispatching before suppression lets an observer see the three-second `npm test` that finished attended and would never have rung anyone. A seam firing only the events a human would have been shown could not serve `dor await` at all.

**Why the gate reads private detector state.** The detector runs for unwatched commands, and other tracks can mask it in the public projection; the gate needs the underlying evidence, not whichever state wins display precedence.

**Why command finishes bypass animation deferral.** A shell-reported exit is a lifecycle event; animation detection is only a recent-output heuristic. Letting the heuristic overrule the event would add latency and let unrelated background output defer a certain completion indefinitely.

**Why a deferred event is not dispatched again.** Claimants already had first refusal when the completion happened; re-offering it at quiet time would let a later-registered await consume history, and would report one completion twice.

## Await

**Why `quiet` includes exit and the bell.** No caller wants "wake me when it settles" and also wants to keep blocking after the thing died: without exit, a crashed peer hangs its caller until the timeout. The bell is in for the opposite reason — an explicit `OSC 9` / `BEL` is *stronger* evidence than inferred silence, so ignoring "I need input" while waiting for the peer to go quiet would be perverse.

**Why `exit` excludes the bell.** Plenty of build tools ring on a warning, and being the strict one is `exit`'s whole job.

**Why `--until` is never inferred.** The WATCHING rule set is a human notification preference — app-global, edited from a dialog. Binding a program's wake condition to it would let an unrelated human edit (removing a command from the watched set to quiet the bell) silently change what every `await` parked on that Session is waiting for.

**Why silence at a prompt is not a settle.** The BUSY-first precondition is what makes the `dor send` / `dor await` idiom safe: the await parks in the window before the peer's first byte instead of resolving on the quiet that was already there.

**Why `idle` is a `cause`, not a failure.** A caller that asked for quiet and found quiet got what it asked for. A distinct cause rather than a distinct failure lets a simple caller treat success as success, while a careful one can still tell "it settled" from "there was never anything there".

**Why a command-exit ring is gated on nothing running.** The ring latches past the run that raised it, so once another command has started it can only describe the previous one — exactly the misreport a `dor send` followed by `dor await --until exit` would act on.

**Why a WATCHING ring is gated on `outputSinceWatchingRing`.** The ring legitimately describes a long-running watched command going quiet — what `--until quiet` exists for — but it is an inference from silence, and nothing clears it when the peer starts talking again; consuming it mid-turn would make the documented `await && read` idiom read a half-drawn screen. The detector cannot stand in for the flag because it never latches: it reports how output looks *now*, and its post-output `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` window (`busyCandidateGap`) is longer than the two CLI round trips between a `dor send` and the await behind it, so it would still read as settled.

**Why an await never sets TODO.** TODO means a human owes this pane attention; after an await nobody does — a program asked to be told, was told, and acted. A stranded TODO also leaks: the last await of an orchestration would mark a fully handled event, and because TODO feeds the Workspace union, an orchestration awaiting across several panes would light the whole Workspace up. A TODO from an *unrelated* earlier event is a different debt and stays owed.

**Why nothing quieter is substituted for the absorbed ring.** A receipt the human must clear by hand is the same noise in a smaller font, and forensics after a failure come from the pane's own scrollback anyway.

**Why the claim window is left unacknowledged.** Closing the gap between a claim and the caller actually reading the outcome would need a two-phase claim on *every* completion, to cover a process that dies in the microseconds after its answer was computed.

**Why the timeout ceiling exists at all.** Like the inactivity timeout, `timeoutMs` originates a process away and ends up in `setTimeout`, whose delay is a signed 32-bit millisecond count. Anything past ~24.9 days overflows and fires immediately, turning a long park into an instant `timeout`.

**Why a disposing VS Code webview answers its own parked requests synchronously.** A caller that can no longer be answered would otherwise go on absorbing completions the human would have been shown. Synchronously, because the cancelled outcome would arrive a microtask after the router stopped posting and be dropped, leaving `dor` blocked on a reply that never comes.

## WATCHING Track

**Why WATCHING keys on the command rather than the Session.** Turning alerts on while `claude` runs is a statement about `claude`, not about the pane that happened to be focused. A per-Session enable would have to be re-established by hand in every new pane, which is the opposite of what the gesture means.

**Why the alert state is retired before the PTY is killed.** A data chunk is enough to create a Session's entry, so killing first leaves output already in flight to rebuild an entry — and a `QuiesceDetector` that nothing will ever dispose. Raw output and resizes are exactly what a dying PTY emits; a semantic or protocol event may revive an id, because an id may be handed to a replacement pane and its first reported command start is evidence that somebody is home.

**Why a mid-command enable shows the current state.** Starting a fresh detector when a rule is added would report `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` for a command that has been busy for ten minutes.

**Why the keystroke fallback is not routed into the manager.** The fallback in `docs/specs/terminal-state.md` is renderer-side and lower confidence than a shell-reported command boundary. Wiring it in would buy integration-less shells a worse version of WATCHING at the price of a second command-tracking path to keep in sync.

## Alarm settings

**Why animation deferral defaults off.** BEL and notification OSCs explicitly ask to alert now, while continuously changing output may never become quiet. Opt-in preserves their established timing and makes indefinite deferral a deliberate choice.

**Why the settings ride the WATCHING rule set's seed/broadcast shape.** Each VS Code webview has its own origin and therefore its own `localStorage`, while the `AlertManager` is shared; without a host-authoritative copy, two webviews would each believe their own blob. The one difference is the whole-blob relay: an alarm setting is not a set of independent keys the way a rule list is.

**Why both sinks share one ring machine.** "Fresh unattended ring, re-checked after the delay, once per ring, never on first observation" is a small pile of rules subtle enough to drift if speech and push each carried a copy.

**Why a first-observation ring never fires.** A restore or a reconnect replays a latched ring, and a persisted session blob can carry one from days ago. Treating that as fresh would buzz the paired phone at every launch.

## Spoken alarms

**Why an entropy heuristic, and what it costs.** A bare token can reach a terminal-supplied title without credential-related wording. Finite samples often fall below their alphabet's maximum entropy, so the cutoffs sit below those maxima and still miss some random tokens. Conversely, `/`, `-`, and `_` are token characters: 135 of this repo's 1102 tracked paths redact (12.3%, measured 2026-09), and `vim lib/src/lib/redact-high-entropy.ts` speaks as `vim REDACTED.ts`. Speech accepts this loss of detail to reduce accidental disclosure. Redacting before punctuation cleanup and truncation prevents those transforms from hiding a token's recognizable shape while leaving its contents speakable.

**Why only hex grouping is normalized.** Grouped hex otherwise falls into the base64 tier and almost always misses its higher cutoff. In review samples of 20,000 random UUIDs, removing hex separators reduced misses from 100% to 0.01%, with no additional matches among the 1102 tracked paths (measured 2026-09). Applying separator removal to other alphabets would also redact `PostgreSQL_Connection_Manager` and `implementation_details_v2`; limiting normalization to hex keeps those identifiers unchanged.

**Why padding must end the candidate.** Absorbing an `=` separator turns `CargoBuildFinished=ok` into `REDACTEDok`. Leaving it for punctuation cleanup yields `REDACTED ok`, preserving the word boundary. Trailing padding belongs to the token and carries no useful speech content.

**Why embedded hex runs are checked.** A non-hex prefix or suffix such as `pod-` or `-log` otherwise moves an entire UUID candidate into the base64 tier, whose higher cutoff misses most such values. Checking every contiguous hex-group run preserves the hex threshold inside those candidates; replacing the enclosing token also avoids speaking credential prefixes or suffixes.

**Why base32 does not require a digit.** Letter-only values are valid base32, including short high-entropy strings that fall below the base64 tier's minimum length. A digit requirement would reduce false positives but intentionally miss those values. The accepted cost extends beyond paths: review measured 663 of 2048 distinct ASCII-letter identifiers of at least 16 characters in `lib/src/` redacting (32.4%, measured 2026-09), including `PostgreSQLConnectionManager` and `CargoBuildFinished`. The cutoff test for `ABCDEFGHJKLMABCD` records that choice.

**Why the label is sanitized before it reaches the engine.** WebKit silently drops an utterance containing angle brackets **and leaves the synthesizer wedged**, so every later utterance is dropped until the page reloads. Pane labels carry chrome like `<idle>`, and terminal-supplied titles reach speech, so any program could permanently disable spoken alarms for the session by putting a `<` in its title. Substituting spaces rather than deleting also keeps adjacent words separate and prevents formatting markers such as `*` from being announced.

**Why the settle path cannot assume an async callback.** Chrome dispatches `start` and then `error` with `not-allowed` *synchronously* inside `speechSynthesis.speak()` when speech is invoked without a user gesture — exactly this call site, since an alarm fires on a timer while the user is away. Reading a variable the caller assigns after `speak()` returns would drop the settle and pin the Session at `speaking` for the rest of the ring.

Guarding only completion leaves a stale `start` free to replace the active utterance's token. Queue-admission identity also covers old rings, collateral redispatch, and evicted callbacks after teardown; it retains one token per ringing Session without retaining each engine utterance.

## Push notifications

**Why both halves live under `remote/burrow/`.** The sink rides the lazily-imported `RemotePairingModalHost` chunk; the shared ring machine and the device store stay in the common bundle instead, since speech and the settings dialog need them everywhere.

**Why `toPushText` is not `toSpokenText`.** The angle-bracket rule exists only because WebKit's synthesizer wedges on them (Spoken alarms); an OS notification has no such failure, and instead has bidi and zero-width formatting that can visually reorder or hide text.

**Why the Burrow, not the Relay, chooses recipients.** A revoked Client keeps its subscription row on the Relay, nothing propagating a revocation today (`docs/specs/remote-security-model.md` → Future), so a Relay picking recipients from its own rows would keep pushing Pane labels to a de-authorized phone.

**Why the Burrow does not ask which devices are subscribed first.** The Relay intersects the Burrow's targets with its own subscriptions regardless, so the target set is identical either way; asking first would cost the alarm a second round trip.

## Settings dialog

**Why the device line always says something.** A push that silently goes nowhere is indistinguishable from a broken one, so each cause is worth its own message rather than an empty list.

## Pane Header

**Why the bell rings only four times.** With four focused ringing bells, the former infinite animation added 6.89 MB of embedder memory, 1,127 style recalculations, and 3.99 seconds of renderer CPU over three minutes. Pausing only those animations in the same loaded document reduced that to 0.13 MB, two recalculations, and 0.025 seconds. After bounding the burst, two consecutive three-minute windows each had zero live animations, one recalculation, under 0.40 MB of non-cumulative embedder drift, and at most 0.024 seconds of renderer CPU (measured in Chrome 150, 2026-09). Four cycles preserve the entry cue without leaving a per-Session animation running for the lifetime of an unattended alert.

**Why a counter, not the status.** Bounding the burst turned a continuous cue into an edge-triggered one, and the public status has no such edge: `hasActiveRing` ORs three independently latching tracks, so a second alert behind a latched one leaves `ALERT_RINGING` in place. `notification` is no better — `applyCommandExitRinging` deliberately preserves a richer protocol notification. With both unchanged, `alertStatesEqual` also judged the two states equal and never emitted, so the renderer could not have reacted even had it wanted to. `ringSeq` is the smallest thing that changes exactly once per latch.

**Why a presentation mount may replay.** Minimizing and reattaching move the visible cue between a Pane and a Door. Replaying once makes the cue legible in its new location without carrying the CSS animation clock through Activity state; the finite burst still expires without further input.

**Why latches and not notifications.** Counting every ring rule instead would let a Session bell-ing in a loop emit one host→webview update per PTY chunk, each restarting a 3.2s burst that never finishes — the always-running animation the finite burst exists to remove. A latch advances the counter at most once while that track remains latched; after release, relatching is a fresh summons and may replay. That matches the model `deferOrDeliverNotification` already states: an existing ring is enrichment, not a fresh summons. A timestamp floor would bound notifications too, but it would put the CSS duration in the manager.

**Why `cfg.alert.ringingPaused` suppresses the burst.** It is the Chromatic freeze that pins the bell; even a bounded animation could otherwise snapshot at an arbitrary phase during its first 3.2 seconds.

## Text And Security

**Why the cold-restore path is not re-sanitized.** Reaching it requires a corrupted or hand-edited session store, and the text is rendered as plain text everywhere, so the residual exposure is layout — a very long or control-bearing string in a preview — rather than markup.

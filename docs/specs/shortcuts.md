# Keyboard Shortcuts

Complete reference for mouseterm's keyboard shortcuts. Shortcuts are grouped by the mode/context in which they apply.

mouseterm has two modes:
- **Workspace mode** (a.k.a. "command" mode internally) — keys drive pane layout.
- **Terminal mode** (a.k.a. "passthrough" mode) — keys go to the running program, except copy/paste and the mode-switch gesture.

## Mode switching

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Left ⌘ → Right ⌘ (within 500 ms) | Toggle mode | Tap left Command, then right Command within 500 ms to swap between workspace and terminal mode. |
| Left Shift → Right Shift (within 500 ms) | Toggle mode | Same as above, but with the Shift keys. |
| `Enter` (workspace) | Enter terminal mode | Switch the selected pane into passthrough (or reattach a minimized door). |

## Pane actions (workspace mode)

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `\|` or `%` | Split left/right | Split the selected pane into two side-by-side panes. |
| `-` or `"` | Split top/bottom | Split the selected pane into two stacked panes. |
| `z` | Toggle zoom | Fullscreen the selected pane, or return to the normal layout. |
| `m` or `d` | Minimize / reattach | Minimize the selected pane to the baseboard, or reattach a minimized door. |
| `k` or `x` | Kill | Kill the selected pane or door. Prompts for a random character to confirm. |
| `,` | Rename | Enter rename mode for the selected pane's title. |

| `↑` / `↓` / `←` / `→` | Move selection | Move selection to the adjacent pane or door. Press the opposite direction to return. |
| `⌘↑` / `⌘↓` / `⌘←` / `⌘→` (macOS)<br>`Ctrl`+arrows (others) | Swap terminals | Swap terminal sessions between two panes — layout and titles swap; selection follows the terminal. |

## Selection & drag

| `Alt` (hold) | Block / linewise | Hold Alt while dragging to toggle between block and linewise selection shape. |

## Copy & paste

| Key | Action | Description |

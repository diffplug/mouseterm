# WebGL Text Rendering (SDF fork + canopy) — Rationale

> Informative companion to [webgl-text.md](webgl-text.md), keyed by that spec's

## Fork pipeline

**Why the peer dependency, not the `-sdfNNN` counter, records the fork base.**
Upstream restarts the beta counter on each release line (`5.6.0-beta.1..143`,
then `6.1.0-beta.1..302`), so a counter alone does not say which line it came
from; only the tarball's `peerDependencies['@xterm/xterm']` names a full
version. Fork releases carry that field as of `0.20.0-sdf301.1`;
`scripts/xterm-lint.mjs` check 1 reads it. The tag/filename check is cheaper,
catching only a URL whose three parts disagree.
The bump command formerly chose the newest release line sharing that counter,
which could repin an old fork onto unrelated core internals. Reading the released
manifest also catches missing releases before any workspace is rewritten.

**Why release assets rather than a registry.** GitHub Packages requires auth
even for public reads; release assets do not, so a tarball URL installs with no
token in a clean checkout or in CI.

**Why "latest of each" is routinely two commits.** Each addon's peer range is
exactly `^<the core version published from the same commit>`, and
`^6.1.0-beta.301` happily admits `6.1.0-beta.302`, so npm and pnpm say nothing
about the mismatch — while the addons compile against core internals, so it is
real. Equality of the peer range against the core pin is the check;
`semver.satisfies` would not catch it.

**What the `pnpm link` residue is.** pnpm 11's link also writes a `link:`
dependency into the ROOT `package.json` and an `overrides:` entry in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, both of which keep resolving the link silently, so a
tarball verification without reverting them verifies the working tree.

## Following upstream

**Why `--dry-run` before accepting Renovate's version.** The newest coherent
per-commit set is often an *older* core than Renovate proposed, because Renovate
takes the latest of each package independently and the counters are not aligned.

**Why a conflict-free merge is not a correct one.** Upstream regularly adds
obligations to code the fork extended without anything textually conflicting, so
the merge succeeds while the extension quietly stops honoring the new contract.
FORK.md's `Merging upstream` carries the same warning.

## SDF glyph architecture

**Why the emoji heuristic errs toward raster.** The two errors are not
symmetric: a text symbol sent to the raster path only loses crispness, while an
emoji sent to the SDF path loses its colors outright. Widening the shared
`isEmoji` range table buys the cheap failure.

**Choosing `sdfGlyphSize`.** Lower = smaller atlas, softer detail; higher = more
corner fidelity under magnification.

**The two ways an alias record goes wrong.** A color variant that *shared* the
canonical record's coordinate vectors would have them transformed more than once
by page merge/delete bookkeeping; one never registered on the page would go
stale after a merge.

**Why the RGB is white.** White survives canvas premultiplication exactly, so
the distance stored in the alpha channel round-trips undistorted.

**What `renderScale` buys.** One low-res atlas renders crisp at any cell size:
it is rasterized once at the base size, never per font size.

## Canopy lab

**Why PUA glyphs are written as escapes.** The literal characters are invisible
in editors, and were once silently dropped in a file rewrite, surfacing as a
rendering regression rather than a diff anyone could read.

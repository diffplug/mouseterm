# Layout — Rationale

> Informative companion to [layout.md](layout.md): the evidence, measurements, and dead-approach history behind its rules, keyed by that spec's headings (AGENTS.md → "What, not why"). Nothing here is normative.

## Pane body

xterm.js paints only its own rendered surface, and integer row fitting leaves a sub-row remainder at the bottom of the pane: a host background differing from the terminal screen shows as a stripe under the last row, and an unclipped host squares off the rounded bottom corners.

## Spoken-alarm overlay

**Why the wash sits below the header.** `--color-alarm-vs-terminal` is picked for contrast against the *terminal body*, so it carries no contrast guarantee over the header band.

**Why a perimeter ring rather than an inset border.** An inset border at the leaf's edge covers nothing, and a ring below the header would break the one-rounded-rectangle read that is the point of the treatment.

**Why header popovers are not a factor.** Every one — pane context menu, title candidates, notification preview, rename warning — portals to `document.body` with `position: fixed`, so it renders in the root stacking context above the whole wall regardless of leaf z-indices.

## Baseboard

**Why `showBaseboard={false}` is a seam.** The mobile Pocket composition — the obvious candidate — is a separate `MobileWall` (`docs/specs/mobile-terminal-ui.md`), not a baseboard-less Wall.

## Mode switching

**Why both gesture tracks stay live everywhere.** Keyboards with no right Meta key are common on Windows and Linux laptops, so the Shift track is the only available gesture there. Keeping both live on every platform avoids a platform switch inside the detector and leaves macOS users a fallback when a hand is already on Shift.

## Split cwd inheritance

**What the shared focus tail costs.** Building a layout by repeated splits means re-entering command mode between each one. Control-plane creation is exempt so a script does not fight the user's focus.

## Selection overlay

The passthrough `solid` variant replaced an original `border: 1px solid ${color}` CSS border, placed pixel-identically — centerline `strokeWidth/2` inside the div edge — so moving both variants onto one SVG renderer changed no geometry.

**The inflate arithmetic.** With `SELECTION_RING_INFLATE_PX` at 4, the 1px passthrough border spans [3px, 4px] from the pane edge — dead centre of the 7px gutter, on whole pixels because the gutter is odd. That is the whole reason `PANE_GUTTER_PX` is odd.

**Why marching is burst-bound.** An infinite SVG stroke animation kept Chrome's renderer active at 60 style recalculations per second while Dormouse was otherwise idle. Measured in Chrome for Testing 150 (2026-09): five focused minutes added 3.77 MB of reclaimable embedder heap and used 24.33 seconds of renderer CPU; pausing only that animation held embedder heap flat (-29 KB) and used 0.017 seconds across a three-minute control. Four cycles preserve the mode/selection cue without leaving a standing allocator after interaction stops.

## Ring travel

**Why the JS tween is not what DESIGN.md bans.** That rule bans CSS *transitions* on layout properties, which the compositor cannot run off the main thread; the overlay writes true interpolated values each rAF frame, inside the same pointer-events-none carve-out the Lath animator holds.

**Why the per-frame writes are imperative.** It is the React-owns-structure / frame-owns-mutations split LathHost already uses for the animator, and the ring is the thing whose smoothness the user is watching.

## Directional motion smear

**Analytic velocity.** An edge at `from + (to - from) * E(t)` moves at `|to - from| * E'(t) / durationMs`, with `E'` from `LATH_EASING.slope`; the house ease-out peaks at `E'(0) = 4.545×` its average speed, which is why the blur belongs on the opening frame, and the closed form is jitter-free by construction. Finite-differencing rendered positions was tried and failed three ways: there is no previous sample on frame one, so the smear was hidden outright for the frame covering ~31% of a 220ms travel; an EMA over it lagged ~1.7 frames; and a backward difference under-reports any decelerating curve, landing the rendered peak mid-travel at ~46% of the true value.

**Extent and intensity.** Ink conservation — dividing alpha by the widening factor — would tie peak alpha to extent, making the effect impossible to strengthen by widening. `smearFullSpeed` stays the single shape knob over a travel: low values pin nearly every move at full smear, high values make the blur track speed.

**Per-edge speeds.** The counterexample: moving between panes flush at the top but differing in height, the top edge translates purely sideways and must stay crisp while the bottom edge moves diagonally and smears hard. A centre velocity averages those into the same wrong answer for both.

**Why two layers, and why corners are separate pieces.** The ring is one closed path so the dash phase runs unbroken around the perimeter, and SVG `stroke-width` is a single scalar — so that one path cannot carry four different widths. A corner has to reach two at once, and opacity cannot vary along a stroke, so a corner can only take the mean of its two edges' (mechanism at `cornerPath`).

**Closed-form dash length.** `1.6232252401402307 × r` is the arc length of the quadratic quarter-turn the path actually draws; the quarter-*circle* value `π/2` is 3% short. `SVGGeometryElement.getTotalLength()` costs a synchronous style+layout flush per frame at a cost scaling with the whole document, and is itself only an approximation (browsers flatten curves to measure) — verified in Safari to agree with the closed form to 6e-4px on a 3253px ring. Dropping it also retired the jsdom `getTotalLength` stubs, so tests assert real dash geometry.

**The `feGaussianBlur` measurements.** WebKit CPU-rasterizes SVG filters every frame: measured in Safari 26.5 (2026-08) at 25.6ms/frame with 31 of 98 frames over 25ms during ring travel, versus a locked 16.7ms with zero dropped frames after the eight-piece smear replaced the filter.

## Inline rename

Pane headers re-render on every activity, terminal-state, and palette change. An editor that re-derived its value (or re-ran `select()`) on those renders would fight the user mid-word — one re-render between two keystrokes and the second keystroke replaces everything typed so far.

## Renderer

**Why the GL context is claimed lazily.** A GL context is a scarce per-page resource, and claiming at create would spend the budget on surfaces that never paint — cold restore builds a session for every persisted pane, minimized doors included. Because eviction is oldest-first and one-way, the panes it demoted would be the earliest-restored ones, permanently.

**DOM-renderer cost.** The DOM renderer emits one `<span>` per style run per row, so a TUI that paints every cell its own truecolor collapses to one span-with-inline-style *per cell*, rebuilt every frame. On a 99×25 pane that is ~1150 elements of style recalc plus layout per frame: measured in Safari 26.5 (2026-08), a single such pane held the whole page at ~110ms/frame (~9fps) while the rest of the app was idle. The same pane on the WebGL renderer holds a locked 60fps (16.6ms, zero frames over 25ms).

**Why the `WebGL2RenderingContext` pre-check exists.** Without it every terminal in a jsdom unit run logs a `getContext` failure before the swallowed constructor throw, which buries real output.

**Context budget.** The per-page live-context cap was measured at 16 in Safari 26.5, evicted oldest-first. The `onContextLoss` → dispose-the-addon → DOM-fallback path was verified live by exhausting the budget and watching the demoted panes keep painting.

**Why image support loads before the renderer.** An ImageAddon registers protocol handlers and draws into canvas layers separate from the text renderer; its renderer hook removes those layers during a WebGL/DOM swap and the next image render recreates them. Loading it only at mount would lose graphics emitted while a Session was minimized — unlike the GL context, which no minimized pane needs. The limits themselves are `docs/specs/terminal-escapes.rationale.md` -> "Inline graphics".

**Verification status.** The numbers above are Safari 26.5; Chrome was checked structurally. Not yet verified inside Tauri's WKWebView (as of 2026-08) — same engine as Safari, and Tauri does not disable the GPU; read `data-renderer` on a pane's host element to confirm.

## Animations

**Why `refitSession` is throttled.** An unthrottled ResizeObserver refits once per animated cell-boundary crossing, so one 440ms motion or a single sash drag costs dozens of xterm reflows and PTY resizes; the throttle collapses that to a handful.

## Kill (two-phase fade + tween reclaim)

**Why the selected-pane check is re-read live.** Navigate away from a dying selected pane and the tail must not yank selection back onto a survivor; navigate onto a dying pane and the tail must adopt a survivor rather than leave selection dangling on a removed leaf. A flag captured when the kill started answers only the first case.

**Which callers hit which branch.** The header kill button is always a selected-pane kill, since clicking the header selects the pane before the button's click handler runs. The not-selected cases in practice are `dor kill` of a background surface and ensure's throwaway teardown.

## Auto-spawn refill

**Why the refill may fire re-entrantly.** The killed pane's fade already sequenced the removal; a delay on top would show an empty Wall for a frame between the two commits.

# Surface Notepad — rationale

Evidence for `docs/specs/notepad.md`, keyed by its headings.

## The archive port

The port could have been "hand the host a mutation and let it apply it". It is a
compare-and-swap instead because the three hosts have nothing in common except
"store a string": the standalone store is a file behind a Rust command, VS Code's
is `globalState` behind a message round trip, and the demo's is a variable. Putting
validation and the mutation in one shared module means one implementation of the
schema, one of the merge, and hosts that cannot drift from each other — the VS Code
extension host imports the very same `applyArchiveMutation` for the teardown case
where no webview is left to ask.

That choice forces the revision token: without one, two webviews (a VS Code window
with the panel and an editor tab both open) each read, apply, and write, and the
later write silently drops the earlier one's batch. A token plus a retry costs one
extra read on the rare collision and loses nothing. The retry is only safe because
mutations are idempotent: the `'conflict'` loop re-applies the same mutation object,
so batch id alone covers it.

A closure attempt that reaches the host, lands, and *then* reports failure (the VS
Code adapter's request timeout does exactly this) leaves the user looking at a
Surface that is still open, so they keep working in it. A fresh batch id per
attempt with dedupe by note id kept the notes added since, but not an edit to one
already stored: the second batch's copy was recognized by id and dropped, so the
archive kept the pre-edit text and `removeSurface` then discarded the edit.
Remembering the id and deleting it in the very mutation that re-appends it replaces
the batch wholesale instead, so edits, additions, and the user's own deletions all
survive. That is why deletes apply before appends, and why the note-id dedupe is
computed after them — otherwise the batch being replaced would still count as
storing its own notes. The dedupe stays because the VS Code mirror path mints a
fresh id per teardown and has nothing to address an earlier write by; a note id is
a UUID, so "already stored" is an exact test there rather than a heuristic.

`MAX_SAVE_ATTEMPTS` is 5. An unbounded retry against an archive somebody else is
rewriting in a loop would spin instead of telling the user, and the closure paths
need a decision — "keep this Surface open" — rather than a hang.

## Capture

Copy Rewrapped exists to make terminal output paste well into a chat window: it
drops frame-only lines, strips box-drawing runs, and joins paragraphs. That is the
wrong transform for a note. A captured excerpt is kept to be looked at again later,
often next to the terminal it came from, and often *because* of its shape — a table,
a tree, a diff. Rewrapping would destroy exactly what made it worth keeping. So the
capture joins soft-wrapped rows (undoing display wrapping, which is not content)
and does nothing else.

Trailing whitespace is trimmed only on rows that end hard for the same reason
`extractSelectionText` does it: a soft-wrapped row is full by definition, so its
trailing spaces are content that the next row continues from, while a hard-ended
row's trailing spaces are just the rest of the terminal grid.

Colors record what xterm *drew* rather than what the program *said*. The alternative
— record palette index 1 and re-resolve it at render time — sounds more faithful
but produces a note that does not match the screenshot in the user's memory: with
`drawBoldTextInBrightColors` on (xterm's default) bold red is drawn as bright red,
and a note showing plain red beside a terminal showing bright red reads as a bug.
The same argument settles inverse: the swap is baked in, with the defaulted side
made explicit, because a note that inverts at render time against a *different*
theme inverts to different colors.

Palette entries 0–15 are read from the live theme and 16–255 computed, because the
first sixteen are the user's and the rest are a fixed formula xterm itself applies.

## Source links

The pin could have stored a scrollback line number. It stores two xterm markers
because a marker is the only handle xterm keeps correct as the buffer scrolls, and
scrolling is the normal case — a capture is usually of something that has already
moved up the screen.

Markers alone are not enough, though: they track lines, not columns, and a resize
reflows the buffer under them. Rather than reimplement reflow tracking, the pin
carries the raw text it captured and refuses to navigate unless the rebuilt range
reads back byte for byte. That turns every failure mode — reflow, trimmed
scrollback, a program that overwrote the rows — into one honest outcome instead of
scrolling the user to plausible-looking wrong output. It is why column restoration
is allowed to be best effort at all.

Failure removes the pin rather than leaving it to fail again. A pin the user can
see is one that resolved the last time it was asked, which is a more useful promise
than a button that sometimes apologizes.

The alternate buffer is the one failure that is not about the capture. A
full-screen program covers the normal buffer rather than rewriting it, so the
markers stay live and the range is still there underneath; the earlier code let
the out-of-range rows fall through to the same removal as a dead pin, which meant
opening a note while `less` was up destroyed the link for good. Checking the
buffer type first separates "hidden right now" from "gone", and only the second
is worth spending the pin on.

## Notepad UI

`beforeinput` is the whole mechanism behind "the first content mutation converts".
It is the one event that names *what* the edit is (`inputType`) for typing,
deletion, cut, and paste alike, and it fires before the DOM changes, so the handler
can cancel it, apply the same edit to the note's plain text, and hand that to the
store — one transition instead of a converted note plus a lost keystroke. React's
synthetic `onBeforeInput` cannot be used: it is built from composition and
`textInput` events, carries no `inputType`, and never fires for a deletion.

Caret movement and selection deliberately do not convert, because reading a rich
note is the common case and losing its colors to a stray arrow key would be a
surprise the user cannot undo.

### The chord on hosts that do not own their keyboard

Cmd/Ctrl+N in an ordinary browser tab opens a new window before any listener runs;
`preventDefault` does not stop it. A demo that showed `Cmd+N` next to "Add to
notepad" would therefore advertise a shortcut that spawns a window and (sometimes)
also adds a note. `browserReservesNotepadChord` lets the adapter say "this build
runs in a browser I do not own", in the style of `hostOwnsTheme`, so the button
stays and the shortcut label and binding both disappear. The shipped Tauri and VS
Code builds own their keyboards and leave it unset.

The chord is gated on a finalized selection for the same reason Ctrl+C is: with no
selection, Ctrl+N is readline's next-history and must reach the program.

## Archive

An unreadable archive is the one place the app could destroy user data by being
helpful. Starting fresh over a file that failed to parse is what most stores do,
and it is unrecoverable — the bytes may be a JSON syntax error one character wide
with a hundred notes behind it. So validation failure is a *state*, not a repair:
every append fails, closures take their failure path, and the Archive view says
plainly that nothing was replaced. Recovery is a single explicit button, and it
moves the data aside rather than deleting it, because only a human can judge
whether what is in there is worth salvaging.

Rejecting unknown fields rather than projecting them away is the same instinct
once more. A reader that keeps the fields it knows and drops the rest looks
forgiving, but every mutation loads, applies, and writes the *whole* archive
back, so the first save after a downgrade would quietly delete whatever a newer
build had stored — notes included, if the newer shape carried them in a field
this one does not have. `version` cannot cover it: it guards breaking changes,
and additive fields are exactly the ones a newer build ships without bumping it.
Refusing turns that into the unreadable state above — visible, and with the data
still on disk — instead of silent loss.

Staged deletion, rather than immediate, follows from the same instinct in the
opposite direction: the archive is where things go to be found weeks later, so a
misclick must be cheap. Holding the set in view state costs nothing, makes Undo
free, and means a failed write leaves the view exactly as it was — the retry is
pressing Back again.

## Closure

Refused closures queue rather than sharing one slot because a Surface with an
unanswered prompt is a Surface the user cannot close. With one slot, killing a
second Surface while the first prompt was up replaced it, and the first Surface was
left holding its notes with nothing on screen left to answer for it.

`dor kill` takes the error and raises no prompt because its caller is an agent or a
script, not someone looking at the Wall: a modal there blocks a window nobody is
watching, and the command already answers with the reason.

The freeze exists because the coordinator snapshots the notes, awaits the host, and
*then* forgets them, and the panel stayed interactive across that await. A note
added in between was deleted having never been archived. An edit was worse: the
batch already held the pre-edit text, so the archive kept a stale copy and the
forget step took the edit with it. Refusing the mutations is what makes the
snapshot and the forget describe the same notes; a counted freeze rather than a
flag is because two closures of one Surface can overlap (a kill retried while the
quit gate is closing everything), and the first to finish must not thaw notes the
second is still writing.

The process CWD is asked for at closure rather than tracked continuously because
it is only knowable while the PTY is alive and only *needed* when a batch is about
to be written. Without it a shell that emits no CWD escape — `cmd.exe`, a bare
`sh`, anything without shell integration — archived `cwd: null` while the host
could have inspected the live process, which is the same fallback the VS Code
session-save path already uses per pane. It is bounded because the refresh sits
between a kill keystroke and the teardown it triggers: a host that never answers
must not hold a Surface open, and what it returns is metadata, so a timeout just
keeps whatever the Session last reported.

## Standalone quit

The gate sits before the first `quit_progress` rather than inside the teardown
because teardown has a standing rule that no failing step prevents exit — that rule
is what keeps a wedged flush from stranding the app. Archiving needs the opposite:
a failure has to be able to stop the quit and ask. Before `quit_progress` the flow
is still in the phase Rust's watchdog does not bound (a human may be looking at the
confirmation dialog), so the dialog can offer Cancel / Quit anyway. Once teardown
starts, nothing may ask a question again.

The failure path leaves the pending quit alone rather than cancelling it, because
`quit_cancel` bumps `seq` and retires the live watchdog: cancelling before the
dialog went up meant a later Quit anyway ran the whole teardown unwatched, with
nothing left to force the exit if the webview wedged. Phase 2's wait is unbounded
precisely so it can sit through a human's decision, so the quit stays pending and
only Cancel — the branch that really does abandon the quit — invokes it.

The deadline aborts the archive it stopped waiting for because `withDeadline` only
stops the *waiting*. The write keeps going, and a success arriving minutes later
called `removeSurface` on every Surface — emptying every notepad in front of a user
who had just been told the notes were not stored and had chosen Cancel.

3 s is the bound because the write is one small file and the user is waiting on a
quit they already asked for; a slower answer is a failure worth surfacing.

The file is a sibling of `sessions/` rather than a member of it because the two have
different lifetimes: session snapshots are per window and swept by `clear_session`,
while archived notes outlive the window that produced them and must survive that
sweep. They share `write_file_atomically` because both carry user text and both
must survive a crash mid-write; that is one implementation, not two.

The revision was a process-local counter until it turned out two processes can hold
this file: `app_data_dir()` is keyed by the Tauri identifier, which `pnpm
dev:standalone` shares with the installed app, and a counter tracks only its own
process's writes — so the loser of an overlapping load→save reported no conflict and
dropped the winner's batches. A content hash is what two processes agree on without
talking, where an mtime is coarse on some filesystems and moves for reasons that are
not a content change; `DefaultHasher` is used because it is fixed-key rather than
randomly seeded, so a second process and a second run derive the same token from the
same bytes. The lock is a separate file rather than the archive's own inode because
every save replaces the archive by rename, leaving a holder locking an inode nobody
will open again. The exposure it closes is the load→save window rather than a torn
write — `write_file_atomically` already ruled that out — since both processes re-read
the file on every mutation, and without an exclusive holder the compare and the
rename interleave.

## VS Code lifecycle

VS Code destroys a webview whenever it likes — an editor tab closed, a window gone,
a panel dragged between containers — and gives the extension no veto and no
reliable "about to be destroyed with these notes" hook. The close coordinator
therefore cannot be the only path. The mirror is the smallest thing that closes the
gap: the webview pushes what a close *would* archive after every change, and the
two endings the extension host *does* see (a `killOnDispose` router disposal, and
`deactivate()`) archive from it.

It is memory only, and that is the point rather than a limitation. A file-backed
draft store would be a second archive with its own staleness, its own recovery
story, and its own disclosure — captured terminal excerpts on disk that no closure
ever wrote. Module state cleared by an extension restart is exactly the lifetime
the mirror needs: one disposal wide.

The snapshot is round-tripped through `readNotepadArchive` on the way in because a
teardown writes it verbatim into the archive with no webview left to validate it,
and one malformed note would make the whole archive unreadable on the next load.

Staged archive deletions leave on *every* disposal, not only a killing one, because
the promise the Archive view makes when it stages them is "irreversible once this
window closes" — and for the user the webview *is* the window. A `WebviewView`
dragged between containers is disposed and re-resolved, and keeping the staged set
meant the new view showed a batch the user had already deleted, still offering
Undo, which `deactivate()` would then delete for real hours later. Committing at
the disposal makes the promise true and leaves nothing pending to hand a resume.

The mirror carries a PTY id purely so a teardown can ask where each process is: the
extension host knows nothing of Surface ids, and `ptyManager.getCwd` answers for the
Session id the webview spawned under. On an editor-panel disposal the kills moved
*after* the archive write for that one reason — the loop used to run first, so by
the time the refresh asked, the PTY it was asking about was already dead. Every
other bookkeeping step in that disposal stayed synchronous and where it was; only
the kills wait, and they run in a `finally`, so a failed write still kills them.

The original `globalState` store was workspace-independent but cached separately
in every extension host. A process-local queue and revision counter therefore
accepted a stale save from another window, dropping the first window's batch
(reproduced 2026-09). The shared file supplies authoritative bytes and revision;
the filesystem lock covers migration, comparison, and replacement. Its envelope
keeps an explicit absent value after recovery so another host's legacy cache
cannot re-import the quarantined data. A unique revision on every write also
recognizes writes that restore identical content.

The lock publishes a nonempty directory atomically. Its unique owner filename
lets a reaper remove only a dead owner's entry; a delayed reaper cannot remove a
new owner's nonempty directory. A live process is never evicted by age, since a
paused extension host could finish its write after another owner acquired the
lock. Contention fails after two seconds. PID reuse may delay reaping until that
process exits, preserving exclusion.

## Live resume

The mirror hydrates a live resume and nothing else because a live resume is the one
case where the notes and the Surfaces they belong to are both still real: any PTYs
never died, the pane ids are the same, and the webview that vanished was a
rendering detail. A cold restore is the opposite — the PTYs are gone, the Surfaces
are rebuilt from a saved snapshot, and any notes still in memory belong to a
previous life of the application. Hydrating there would resurrect notes for
Surfaces the user already ended, which is worse than losing them.

`loadVolatile()` is consumed exactly once for that reason: a second read could only
be a later, colder boot's.

The mirror is served non-destructively (the resuming webview re-reports the notes
under its own router, re-establishing ownership) so that a webview which boots and
then crashes before its first sync still has its notes archived by `deactivate()`.

A browser-only view has no PTY to mark its resume as live. Its volatile mirror is
still evidence of the same extension-host lifetime: a restart clears that module
state and supplies no mirror. Rebuilding the browser layout before hydration
preserves both visible and minimized browser notes, while terminal cold restores
still never consume the mirror.

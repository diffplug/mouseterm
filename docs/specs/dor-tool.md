# Dor Tools

> See `docs/specs/glossary.md` for Surface / Session / Pane / Door vocabulary.
> Owns tool designation, configuration, trust workflow, serving, and command lifecycle. Browser chrome belongs to `docs/specs/dor-browser.md`; notes and closure belong to `docs/specs/notepad.md`; helpers belong to `docs/specs/terminal-context.md`.
> Status: implemented behind `dormouse.flags.tools`, off by default. Unbuilt design is under [Future](#future).

## Files

- `dor/src/commands/tool.ts` — CLI entry and generated help.
- `lib/src/host/tool-host.ts` — shared host lookup and trust entry.
- `lib/src/components/wall/use-dor-control.ts` — launch, approval placement, dedupe, and response orchestration.
- `lib/src/components/wall/use-tool-serving.ts` — port discovery and browser lifetime.
- `lib/src/components/wall/ToolPanel.tsx` — terminal/browser composition.

## Capability gating

**Must gate tool creation on `isToolsEnabled`.** The flag disables designation, not parsing of inert announcements or the capability predicates. Capability semantics belong to `docs/specs/glossary.md` → Panes and Surfaces; CLI reporting belongs to `docs/specs/dor-cli.md` → `dor list`.

Source of truth: `isToolsEnabled` in `lib/src/lib/feature-flags.ts`; `surface.tool` in `lib/src/components/wall/use-dor-control.ts`.

## The tool capability set

**Must designate the Surface as `tool` before its command starts serving.** A Tool has terminal and browser capabilities, including while booting, awaiting approval, showing a port conflict, or resting at a prompt after command exit. Browser operations still require the renderer/session they operate on.

- **Must retain the Session id, public Surface ref, terminal and notes across serving and renderer changes.** These are changes within one Surface.
- **Must bypass browser `replaceSurface` for Tool renderer swaps**, mutating the Tool's params and releasing the retired browser resources.
- **Must run the terminal Activity model for a Tool**, including when its browser is visible. Watched-command defaults belong to `docs/specs/alert.md`.
- **Must mark input to either capability as touching the Tool.** Never apply the untouched-shell kill or shell-replacement shortcut to a Tool.
- **Must classify Tool params before browser params**, since a serving Tool carries `renderMode` too.

Source of truth: `surfaceKindFromParams` / `isToolParams` in `lib/src/components/wall/browser-surface.ts`; `onSwapRenderMode` / `requestKill` in `lib/src/components/Wall.tsx`; `lib/src/components/wall/tool-surface.test.ts`.

## Declaring tools

**Must resolve a named Tool from the nearest ancestor `dormouse.yml`.** The host owns discovery, bounded reads, YAML parsing, and substitutions; the renderer receives the resolved result. Canonical field shapes are `ToolEntry` in `lib/src/host/tool-registry.ts`.

| Field | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `run` | Required command, typed into the configured shell after integration readiness |
| `render` | `iframe` by default, or `ab-screencast` |
| `port` | `announced` by default, or `auto`; [Serving](#serving) owns selection |
| `prespawn_dedupe` | Optional scalar or list of literal key elements with substitutions |

- **Must reject unknown `prespawn_*` fields and unknown substitutions**; unknown ordinary fields produce warnings. The substitution set is `$PROJECT_ROOT`, the declaring directory, and `$CWD`, the caller's resolved directory. (rationale)
- **Must preserve scalar `prespawn_dedupe` as a one-element literal list**, never interpret it as a command to execute. Reserve separate fields for future computed keys. (rationale)
- **Must warn when a repo-local key omits `$PROJECT_ROOT`**, while allowing intentional cross-checkout dedupe.
- Reserved: **Must reject `$PROJECT_ROOT` in the future user-global configuration**, which has no project root; see scope **dor-tools** under [Future](#future).

Source of truth: `lookupTool` in `lib/src/host/tool-trust.ts`; `parseToolFile` / `resolveDedupeKey` in `lib/src/host/tool-registry.ts`; `lib/src/host/tool-registry.test.ts`.

## Identity and dedupe

**Must dedupe only when an explicit key exists and `--fresh` is absent.** Neither a command nor its CWD implicitly creates identity; anonymous `dor tool -- <command>` invocations create fresh Surfaces. (rationale)

- **Must namespace keys by the host-resolved Tool name**; runtime output supplies scope elements, never another Tool's namespace.
- **Must serialize Tool launch requests in the renderer**, covering lookup, matching, creation, and startup. The current lock serializes all Tool requests, not only matching keys.
- **Must reveal a live matching Tool and report `existing` without sending input.** An idle match restarts its stored command in its own directory and reports `adopted`; a failed restart reports an error.
- **Must reuse and reveal a matching pending approval Surface**, preserving its approval state and reporting `pending`.
- **Must apply runtime re-keys only to the announcing Tool**, without merging Surfaces, transferring state, or killing either side of a collision. (rationale)

## Trust

**Must obtain a recorded grant before executing a repo-local named Tool.** Anonymous command invocations carry the caller's explicit command and require no repo-config grant. The local authority boundary belongs to `docs/specs/security-local.md` → Dor Tool configuration.

1. **Must derive grant keys host-side from the canonical upstream remote URL or project-root folder.** Either recorded key satisfies lookup; upstream trust spans clones and worktrees. (rationale)
2. **Must present unapproved named invocations in a visible pending Tool pane**, returning `pending` without spawning a PTY. Defer requested minimization until approval. Pending approval is never persisted as a runnable Tool.
3. **Must grant only through the approval controls in Dormouse chrome**, never through a `dor` verb or terminal output. The prompt names the proposed command; it is not itself executable terminal content. (rationale)
4. **Must re-resolve the named entry after the grant is written**, then stage the resolved command, renderer, port strategy, and key before exposing its terminal. A Surface closed during the host calls must not start later.
5. **Must close a declined approval through the ordinary close coordinator and record no denial.** Archive failure may retain the pane. (rationale)
6. **Must share grant updates safely across host processes**, merging against the latest file under the existing lock and atomic-write protocol.
7. **Never content-hash grants or re-prompt solely because the config changed.** (rationale)

Reserved: **Must keep future implicit glob dispatch user-global and limited to user-global Tools**, and gate any future repo `prespawn_*` execution on the same approval; see scope **dor-tools** under [Future](#future).

Tests: `lib/src/host/tool-trust.test.ts`, `lib/src/components/Wall.test.tsx`.

## Serving

**Must frame only a port returned by the Tool Session's process-tree scan while its designated command is current.** An OSC announcement selects a discovered port; it cannot supply an arbitrary listening service or designate an ordinary terminal as a Tool. Recheck the command run after asynchronous discovery and browser startup.

| Policy | Selection |
| --- | --- |
| Announced port present | Match that exact port in the scan; absent match frames nothing |
| `port: announced`, no announced port | Frame nothing |
| `port: auto`, no announced port | Wait for one unchanged scan tick; one port frames, several show a conflict, zero keeps waiting |
| Anonymous command | Uses `auto` |

- **Must poll unbound Tools every 1.5 seconds while their command runs.** Reset settle memory on command exit. (rationale)
- **Must let a changed announced port override a committed conflict or browser**, but only after a matching scan. An unchanged announcement never undoes URL-bar navigation. (rationale)
- **Must stop ordinary port scans once a browser or conflict is committed.** An unannounced additional port appearing after settle is not detected.
- **Must display the browser destination before awaiting agent-browser startup**, leaving the session-less renderer inert until the binding arrives. Close any browser session whose Tool disappeared or changed command during startup.
- **Must retain a runtime re-key within the Tool's namespace**, following [Identity and dedupe](#identity-and-dedupe).

Reserved: **Must derive a Tool's URL again on cold restore**, compatible with future `prespawn_port` and `DORMOUSE_TOOL_PORT` in scope **dor-tools**; [Persistence and hosts](#persistence-and-hosts) owns the saved projection.

## Lifecycle

**Must create a shell-hosted PTY and type the command only after integration readiness.** An unsupported shell fails before launch; integration timeout or cancellation closes the temporary Surface through the notepad close coordinator, retaining it if closure fails.

| Transition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Spawn | Terminal visible; Tool identity already established |
| Serving | Browser becomes visible in the same Surface |
| Port conflict | Explanation occupies the browser half; terminal remains available |
| Command exit or different command | Browser resources retire and terminal becomes visible |
| Re-run stored command | Same Surface may serve again |
| Kill | Notes archive and helper guards settle before PTY/browser teardown |

**Must show the full terminal before serving and after command exit.** A serving Tool shows its browser, and Terminal Context reveals the same primary terminal (`docs/specs/terminal-context.md` → Tool context). Keep the browser mounted behind context, and keep the hidden terminal sized with `visibility` and `inert`, never `display: none`. Pending approval mounts neither capability.

Notepad follows `docs/specs/notepad.md` → Notepad UI. Tool context follows `docs/specs/terminal-context.md` → Tool context.

Tests: `lib/src/components/wall/ToolPanel.test.tsx`, `lib/src/components/Wall.test.tsx`.

## CLI

**Must split focus-neutrally for a new Tool and return its Surface handle.** Calling-pane take-over is staged under [Future](#future). A matching Tool follows [Identity and dedupe](#identity-and-dedupe).

**Must retain `dor tool` as a Surface-producing command on every supported host**, never route it to a native editor. Generated help owns syntax and response types own shape.

Source of truth: `toolCommand` in `dor/src/commands/tool.ts`; `dor/test/snapshots/help/tool.md`; `ToolSurfaceResponse` in `dor/src/commands/types.ts`.

## Take-over

**Must run a standalone `dor tool` invocation in its calling pane when every takeover condition holds.** Otherwise use the ordinary split path. Trust approval and keyed reuse take precedence. (rationale)

| Condition | Required state |
| --- | --- |
| Caller | Visible, integrated plain terminal; not closing or dying |
| Command line | OSC 633 reports `dor tool` alone; compound shell syntax rejects takeover |
| Directory | Resolved Tool CWD equals the caller's reported CWD |
| Placement | Neither `--surface` nor `--minimize` supplied |
| Helper | No existing auxiliary helper; preserve it by splitting |
| Trust | Already approved; pending approval always uses its own pane |

**Must answer `takeover` before waiting for the calling shell's prompt**, then transform and type the command. The answer promises placement, not successful command startup.

- **Must leave the caller unchanged on prompt timeout or cancellation**, and recheck visibility, closing state, CWD, kind, and helper presence after the wait. A helper opened during the handshake prevents transformation.
- **Must change components and params in one metadata commit**, retaining the Session id, Surface ref, scrollback, notes, source pins, and any user rename.
- **Must clear previous OSC 367 hints before typing the new command.**
- **Must retain the spawn lock until the typed command is observed running or a new completed run is observed**, or the wait ends. A command that starts and exits between samples releases the lock too.
- **Must rerun a keyed match in the caller through the same answer/prompt handshake**, reporting `adopted`, when its line is standalone and integrated. Never interrupt the waiting `dor` process. Placement flags do not relocate an existing match; run in its current directory.
- **Must report an error when the caller is the keyed match but its command line cannot be typed behind**, instead of reporting a misleading `existing` result.
- **May interleave user keystrokes arriving between the prompt and command injection.** Takeover does not reserve the shell input buffer.
- **Must include already-owned background listeners in the usual process-tree scan.** Under `auto`, they can become the sole candidate or cause a conflict.

Tests: `lib/src/components/wall/tool-takeover.test.ts`, `lib/src/components/Wall.test.tsx`.

## OSC 367

**Must consume OSC 367 at the PTY owner's parser**, including malformed and unknown verbs, and emit no reply. `serve` is the only implemented verb. The escape registry is `docs/specs/terminal-escapes.md`.

- **Must sanitize and bound the payload before retaining it.** `ToolAnnounce` and `parseToolAnnounce` own the field shapes and validation limits.
- **Must forward parsed announcements from the host to the owning renderer**, which records the latest announcement per Session. Standalone uses `terminal:protocolEvents`; VS Code uses `terminal:toolAnnounce` scoped to the owning webview. The fake adapter applies locally.
- **Must reconstruct announcements from raw replay without emitting replies**, and clear the renderer record on Session disposal. Ordinary terminal announcements stay inert.
- Reserved: **Must retain `name`, `dehydrate`, and `persist` as inert parsed fields**, serving the announced-name and D1/D2 items under [Future](#future). Neither `persist: never` nor a `dehydrate` verb changes current persistence.
- Reserved: **Never assign a third OSC 367 verb**; `dehydrate` belongs to D2 under [Future](#future), while existing title/progress protocols keep those roles.

Tests: `lib/src/lib/tool-announce.test.ts`, `standalone/scripts/dev-agent-browser-announce.test.mjs`.

## Security

The Tool-specific local boundaries are `docs/specs/security-local.md` → Dor Tool configuration. Browser content follows `docs/specs/security-local.md` → Browser panes. Serving authority follows [Serving](#serving); approval workflow follows [Trust](#trust).

## Persistence and hosts

**Must persist the command and stable Tool metadata with `surfaceType: 'tool'`**, retaining the ordinary CWD field. Never persist a derived URL, browser session binding, conflict, pending approval, or visibility toggle as runnable Tool state. Live notes follow `docs/specs/notepad.md` → Live resume.

**Must cold-restore an approved Tool by starting its saved command through integration-gated shell readiness**, then rediscover its port. Agent-resume commands do not override the saved Tool command. Pending approvals restore as ordinary terminals and execute nothing. **Must rebuild visible Tool metadata from its pane row when layout geometry is unusable**, rather than starting the command in a plain terminal with no serving behavior.

**Must provide Tool host operations in standalone and VS Code.** Remote terminal transport remains protocol-v1; remote browser presentation is staged in `docs/specs/remote-api.md`.

Tests: `lib/src/lib/session-save.test.ts`, `lib/src/lib/session-restore.test.ts`.

## Future

**Scope: dor-tools** — remaining design, in implementation order.

- **C — glob table + `dor open`.** The user-global tools file, glob rules
  (pattern → tool name), `dor open <target>` as sugar over `dor tool`, argument
  substitution in `prespawn_dedupe` so per-target viewers do not collapse into
  one pane, and the loopback file/viewer endpoint a local *file* needs (the
  iframe proxy instruments only `http://` upstreams).
- **D1 — reaping without cooperation.** Idle-threshold reap +
  rehydrate-from-args + `persist: "never"`: every stateless tool, no new API,
  no Windows question.
- **D2 — dehydrate/rehydrate.** The `367;dehydrate` verb +
  `DORMOUSE_DEHYDRATE`; the `dehydrate` flag is reserved in the serve payload
  from the shipped `serve` payload. The Windows graceful-stop is needed here
  only.
- **The announced `name`.** Wire the reserved [OSC 367](#osc-367) `name` into
  the title-candidates channel and `dor list`'s location column.
- **Later** — `prespawn_*` beyond the dedupe literal: a computed key, and
  `prespawn_port`. Pocket/remote browser view (rides the browser-surface
  staging in `docs/specs/remote-api.md`; reserve the kind on the wire now). An in-pane terminal/browser strip (decide against the
  glossary's reserved multiple-Surfaces-per-Pane). A `boots: web` hint if the
  terminal flash grates. `--has terminal` / `--has browser` for `dor list`.

### Dehydrate and rehydrate

For tools announcing `dehydrate: true`. Reap on an idle threshold while
`Doored` / `Hidden` — including an inactive Workspace's Surfaces — **never on
the minimize itself** (reattach must not cost a boot) or under memory pressure.
The headline case is Workspaces: an inactive one full of dehydratable tools
drops to zero processes, relieving the parked-surface pressure the workspaces
rollout projects (`docs/specs/layout.md` Stage 4; `MAX_PARKED_SURFACES` in
`docs/specs/tiling-engine.md`).

**This is an in-session mechanism.** The payload lives with the running host;
whether it survives a host quit follows each host's session-persistence story
(`docs/specs/transport.md`). The flow: host sends the graceful-stop signal →
tool emits `367;dehydrate;{json}` on the way out → rehydrate respawns with
`DORMOUSE_DEHYDRATE` in the env.

**Args-only restart is the mandatory floor; the payload is fidelity, never
correctness.** Degradation is Lath-restore-token style — dehydrated state →
bare args → error. Small versioned JSON, never a document. A hung tool blocks
nothing: request, grace, kill anyway, fall back to args.

### Open questions

The [OSC 367](#osc-367) collision sweep before the contract is frozen (xterm
ctlseqs plus the iTerm2/kitty/WezTerm/ConEmu private ranges; runners-up 3676
and 4242); the Windows graceful-stop for D2; the dehydrate idle-threshold
default; whether `persist` belongs in the announce or the file (currently the
announce — self-knowledge, like a runtime re-key); the final marketing noun
("Dor Tools" carries the LLM-tool-use collision-avoidance; the spec says
"tool" throughout).

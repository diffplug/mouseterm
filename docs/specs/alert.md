# Alert Spec

## Goal

The alert system is an opt-in reminder for a **Session** that may finish work while the user is looking elsewhere. Alert state lives on the Session itself, not on the Pane or Door that currently displays it.

This spec uses semantic state names that describe what the Session currently owes the user:

- `NOTHING_TO_SHOW`
- `MIGHT_BE_BUSY`
- `BUSY`
- `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION`
- `ALERT_RINGING`

This document is the source of truth for the naming and behavior of this state machine.

## Non-goals

- No command sniffing or per-tool heuristics. We do not try to guess whether `vim`, `npm dev`, `claude`, or any other command is "appropriate" for alerts.
- No sound, OS notifications, or browser notifications in v1.
- No Door-specific alert menu that overrides the existing click-to-reattach behavior from `docs/specs/layout.md`.

## When alerts are useful

Alerts are most useful for sessions such as:

- long-running jobs that eventually finish, such as signing, notarization, deploys, or test runs
- slow human-in-the-loop sessions, such as AI chats where the user may switch to other work

Alerts are usually not useful for sessions such as:

- continuous background output, such as `npm dev`
- fast local interactive tools where the user is already present
- read-only streams that the user expects to keep changing forever

This is guidance only. The system does not auto-enable or auto-disable alerts based on process name, shell command, exit code, or output patterns.

## Data model

Each Session owns:

- `status: 'ALERT_DISABLED' | 'NOTHING_TO_SHOW' | 'MIGHT_BE_BUSY' | 'BUSY' | 'MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION' | 'ALERT_RINGING'`
  - This is the unified alert and activity state for the Session.
  - `ALERT_DISABLED`: alert is off; no activity tracking is performed. Default state.
  - Stable states: `ALERT_DISABLED`, `NOTHING_TO_SHOW`, `BUSY`, `ALERT_RINGING`.
  - Transitional states: `MIGHT_BE_BUSY`, `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION`.
  - When the user enables the alert, status transitions from `ALERT_DISABLED` to `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` and activity tracking begins fresh from that moment.
  - When the user disables the alert, activity tracking stops and status returns to `ALERT_DISABLED`.
- `todo: boolean`
  - Reminder state for the Session. Default `false`.
  - `false`: no TODO.
  - `true`: TODO is shown. It may be set explicitly by the user, or auto-created when a ringing alert is dismissed by attention or by the bell.
  - Dismissing a ringing alert when `todo` is already `true` leaves it `true`.
  - Legacy persisted TODO encodings migrate into this boolean shape: `-1` / `false` / unknown values become `false`; numeric soft buckets, `2`, `'soft'`, and `'hard'` become `true`.

Each Session also owns:

- `attentionDismissedRing: boolean`
  - True when the user attended to a ringing Session (clicked into the Pane, typed in passthrough, etc.). Cleared when the bell is next clicked or the alert is toggled/disabled. Used by the bell button to show the context menu on the next click instead of immediately disabling.

The workspace owns:

- `attentionSessionId: string | null`
  - Which Session currently has the user's attention.
- `attentionTimer: timeout handle | null`
  - Auto-clears `attentionSessionId` after `T_USER_ATTENTION`. Reset on each new attention event.

Important invariants:

- Alert state is session-scoped and survives Pane <-> Door transitions.
- `status` describes what the Session owes the user since the last explicit attention boundary.
- Destroying a Session clears `todo` with it; the activity monitor is disposed.
- Re-rendering, theme changes, resize reflow, or remounting a Pane must not create a new alert by themselves.

## Attention model

We only ring when a Session produces a completion signal and the user is not actively attending to that Session.

`attentionSessionId` is set only by explicit user actions that plausibly mean "I am looking at this Session now":

- clicking a Pane body or Pane header
- entering passthrough on a Pane
- typing into a Session in passthrough
- clicking a Door or pressing `Enter` on a Door, because both reattach into passthrough

These do **not** count as attention:

- a Session merely being visible
- a Session merely being selected in command mode
- hovering
- a Door existing in the baseboard
- reattaching a Door with `d`, because that restores the Pane but stays in command mode

Attention is cleared when:

- the user has not explicitly interacted with that Session for `T_USER_ATTENTION`
- the app loses focus
- the Session is minimized into a Door while it had attention
- the Session is destroyed

`T_USER_ATTENTION` is intentionally finite so a user can run a slow command, walk away, and still get a visual alert later even if that Pane remained selected. Start with 15s and tune with real usage.

Doors never directly hold attention. A Door can only regain attention by being restored into a Pane through an action that enters passthrough.

## State model

The point of the state machine is not to model every output blip. It is to answer a narrow question:

- Does this Session currently have nothing worth surfacing?
- Does it appear to be busy with ongoing work?
- Has it likely finished and now needs attention?

The `MIGHT_*` states exist only to absorb uncertainty. They are debounce states, not user-facing end states.

### Timing reference

| Timer | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `T_BUSY_CANDIDATE_GAP` | 1.5 s | enough elapsed time to treat ongoing output as a possible busy transition |
| `T_BUSY_CONFIRM_GAP` | 500 ms | window in `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` before reverting to `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` if no further output |
| `T_MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` | 2 s | silence after `BUSY` before suspecting completion |
| `T_ALERT_RINGING_CONFIRM` | 3 s | additional silence before confirming `ALERT_RINGING` |
| `T_RESIZE_DEBOUNCE` | 500 ms | ignore resize redraw noise |
| `T_USER_ATTENTION` | 15 s | attention idle expiry |

All values are configurable via `cfg.alert`. Total silence from last meaningful output to `ALERT_RINGING`: 5 s (`T_MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` + `T_ALERT_RINGING_CONFIRM`).

### State semantics

- `NOTHING_TO_SHOW`
  - Default state.
  - The Session does not currently owe the user a reminder.
  - Immediate command echo or a single quick response is not enough to leave this state.

- `MIGHT_BE_BUSY`
  - Transitional state entered when output suggests the Session may be moving from a quick response into ongoing work.
  - If that suspicion is not confirmed quickly, fall back to `NOTHING_TO_SHOW`.

- `BUSY`
  - Stable state.
  - There is enough evidence that the Session is doing ongoing work and may later produce something worth surfacing.

- `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION`
  - Transitional state entered when a `BUSY` Session goes quiet.
  - This may be true completion, or only a pause in output.

- `ALERT_RINGING`
  - Stable state.
  - The Session likely completed a meaningful unit of work and the alert is actively ringing.

### Transition rules

| Current | Event | Next | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| any | explicit attention boundary | `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | Clicking into the Pane, typing in passthrough, or restoring a Door via click/`Enter` starts a new cycle. |
| `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | first meaningful output after an attention boundary | `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | A single output burst may be only immediate feedback. |
| `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | another meaningful output arrives after `T_BUSY_CANDIDATE_GAP`, or multiple rapid outputs continue through that gap | `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` | The Session may be entering a longer-running phase. |
| `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` | further output confirms ongoing work within `T_BUSY_CONFIRM_GAP` | `BUSY` | Enough evidence to treat the Session as busy. |
| `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` | output stops before confirmation | `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | False positive; it was just a quick response. |
| `BUSY` | more meaningful output | `BUSY` | Stay busy. |
| `BUSY` | no meaningful output for `T_MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` | `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` | The Session may have finished, or may only be pausing. |
| `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` | output resumes | `BUSY` | It was only a pause. |
| `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` | silence continues for `T_ALERT_RINGING_CONFIRM` and the Session lacks attention | `ALERT_RINGING` | This is the alert-eligible completion transition. |
| `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` | silence continues for `T_ALERT_RINGING_CONFIRM` but the Session has attention | `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | The user already sees it; no reminder is owed. |
| `ALERT_RINGING` | explicit attention boundary | `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` | The user attended to the result. |
| `ALERT_RINGING` | new meaningful output and the Session has attention | `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` | A new work cycle may be starting. |
| `ALERT_RINGING` | new meaningful output but the Session lacks attention | `ALERT_RINGING` | Latch: new output does not silently clear the alert without user awareness. |

### Meaningful output

`Meaningful output` means terminal output that is not suppressed as incidental UI churn. In particular:

- output during `T_RESIZE_DEBOUNCE` does not count
- theme changes, remounts, or DOM reparenting do not count
- pure selection or focus changes do not count

The implementation may later learn additional suppressions, but this spec only requires resize churn suppression today.

## Alert trigger

Alert logic is driven entirely by transitions in `status`.

### Ringing starts when all of these are true

- the Session has an active activity monitor (i.e. `status !== 'ALERT_DISABLED'`)
- the Session transitions from `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` into `ALERT_RINGING`
- the Session does not currently have attention

### Ringing does not start when any of these are true

- the Session already has attention at the moment it would otherwise enter `ALERT_RINGING`
- the Session is merely re-rendered or reattached while already `ALERT_RINGING`
- the only recent output was resize noise already ignored by the completion detector
- the alert is disabled (`status === 'ALERT_DISABLED'`)

This "fresh transition into `ALERT_RINGING` only" rule is critical. It prevents duplicate alerts on remount, theme change, or Pane <-> Door movement.

## Alert clearing rules

The Session leaves `ALERT_RINGING` and returns to `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` when any of these happen:

- the user attends to the Session (clicking into the Pane, typing in passthrough, restoring a Door via click/`Enter`)
- the user dismisses the alert (clicking the ringing bell, pressing `a`)
- the user marks the Session as TODO (`t` key or context menu)
- new output arrives while the Session has attention (starts a new `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` cycle; without attention the alert stays ringing — see latch in transition rules)

All attention-based dismissals (the first three above) set `todo = true` if it is not already set. This prevents phantom dismissals where the alert vanishes without a trace. Once the TODO is visible, the user can clear it explicitly from the pill/dialog or by pressing `Enter` into that Session. Synthetic terminal reports (focus events, cursor-position responses) do not count as user input for clearing.

The Session leaves `ALERT_RINGING` and returns to `ALERT_DISABLED` when:

- the user disables alerts on that Session (disposes the activity monitor)

The Session's alert state is cleared entirely when:

- the Session is destroyed

If more output arrives later and the Session makes a fresh transition back into `ALERT_RINGING`, the alert rings again.

Marking a Session as TODO resets the alert to `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` and sets `todo = true`, but it does **not** disable future alerts. `todo` and the alert toggle are separate concerns.

Disabling alerts disposes the activity monitor and returns `status` to `ALERT_DISABLED`.

## UI

### Pane header

The Pane header exposes two independent concepts:

- TODO pill
- alert button

TODO pill:

- toggled in command mode with `t` (`false` -> `true` -> `false`)
- shown when `todo === true`
- auto-created on alert dismiss or attention-based alert clearing
- pressing `Enter` into a Session with TODO clears it
- clicking the TODO pill clears it
- when TODO clears, the pill briefly morphs to a `✓` glyph in the success color (~500 ms) before unmounting — this marks the moment of completion so the pill never vanishes silently
- no empty placeholder when off

Alert button:

- shown in all header tiers, including compact and minimal
- icon-only control with tooltip and accessible label
- visual states (pure function of `status`):
  - `ALERT_DISABLED`: `BellSlashIcon`, muted
  - `NOTHING_TO_SHOW`: `BellIcon` filled, muted, upright
  - `MIGHT_BE_BUSY`: `BellIcon` filled, muted, tilted slightly (-22.5°)
  - `BUSY`: `BellIcon` filled, muted, tilted 45°
  - `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION`: `BellIcon` filled, muted, tilted 60°
  - `ALERT_RINGING`: `BellIcon` filled, warning color, rocking animation (±45° bell-ring keyframe); reduced-motion: static 45° tilt
- escalation is conveyed by increasing tilt angle, not by a separate badge element
- the tilt/animation must not change the button's layout size

Interaction (`dismissOrToggleAlert` state machine):

- left-click the bell while `ALERT_DISABLED`: enables the alert (creates activity monitor)
- left-click the bell while `ALERT_RINGING`: dismisses the alert, creates a TODO if none exists, then opens the context menu anchored below the button
- left-click the bell after an attention-based dismissal (`attentionDismissedRing` is set): clears the flag and opens the context menu. This lets the user access TODO/disable options after attending to a ringing Session without requiring a right-click.
- left-click the bell in any other enabled state: disables the alert (destroys activity monitor)
- pressing `a` on a selected Pane in command mode: same as left-click
- right-click the bell (any state): opens a context menu with:
  - a TODO on/off switch with `[t]` shortcut hint
  - an alert on/off switch with `[a]` shortcut hint
  - brief description of TODO clearing behavior
- tooltip includes "Right-click for options" hint

The alert control has higher layout priority than split or zoom controls. Long titles must truncate before the bell disappears.

### Door

A Door is display-only for alert state in v1. It must not replace the existing Door primary actions defined in `docs/specs/layout.md`.

Door indicators:

- show bell indicator only when `status !== 'ALERT_DISABLED'`
- show TODO pill when `todo === true`
- if `status === 'ALERT_RINGING'`, the Door bell icon uses warning color and the same rocking animation as the Pane header
- the Door bell icon shows the same tilt angles as the Pane header for escalation states

Door interaction:

- click or `Enter` keeps its existing meaning: reattach and enter passthrough
- `d` keeps its existing meaning: reattach and stay in command mode
- alert-specific actions are manipulated after restore, from the Pane header UI

Consequences:

- clicking or `Enter` on a ringing Door counts as attention and clears the ring
- `d` on a ringing Door does not count as attention, so the ring remains until the user explicitly attends, dismisses, or disables

## Hardening requirements

### Text overflow and narrow layouts

- Session titles may contain long text, emoji, CJK, RTL text, combining marks, and shell prompts with paths.
- Pane titles and Door titles must use `min-width: 0` plus truncation so indicators do not overflow their containers.
- Bell and TODO indicators must be fixed-width, non-shrinking affordances.
- The ringing treatment must not change layout size. No border-width jumps, no icon-size jumps.
- If header space becomes extremely tight, the TODO pill may collapse before the alert control does.

### Accessibility and motion

- Ringing must not rely on color alone. Use icon state plus outline, fill, or pulse.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. In reduced-motion mode, replace the rocking animation with a steady 45° tilt. All tilt states are static transforms and work unchanged regardless of motion preference.
- Bell button must expose accurate `aria-label` text:
  - "Enable alert"
  - "Disable alert"
  - "Alert ringing"
- TODO pill and bell actions must remain keyboard reachable.
- Any ringing modal or popover must trap focus, support `Escape`, and restore focus to the bell button when closed.

### Session and lifecycle edge cases

- Multiple Sessions may ring at once. Alert state is independent per Session.
- Minimizing or reattaching a ringing Session preserves the ring because the ring belongs to the Session.
- A Session that exits while ringing continues to ring until attended, dismissed, disabled, or destroyed by the user.
- Killing the Session clears all alert and TODO state because the Session no longer exists.
- If output resumes while a Session is ringing and the Session has attention, the ring clears and the Session returns to the normal state-machine flow. If the Session lacks attention, the ring persists (latch behavior prevents silent dismissal).
- App blur clears attention but does not dismiss existing rings.

### Internationalization

- Icon-only header controls avoid fixed-width translated labels.
- Tooltips, menus, and modal actions must wrap cleanly for longer translations.
- Use logical CSS properties where layout direction matters so RTL remains correct.
- The literal TODO pill may remain `TODO` in v1, but the layout must tolerate a longer localized label later.

## Scenarios

### Slow response, same pane, user walks away

- User enables alert on a Pane.
- User runs a slow command.
- The Session progresses through `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` and `BUSY`.
- The Session later goes quiet, then transitions through `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` into `ALERT_RINGING`.
- If `T_USER_ATTENTION` has expired, the Pane rings even if it remained selected.

### Slow response, user switched elsewhere

- User enables alert on Session A.
- Session A becomes `MIGHT_BE_BUSY`, then `BUSY`.
- User works in Session B or another app.
- Session A later goes quiet long enough to transition into `ALERT_RINGING`.
- Session A rings because it does not have attention.

### Door rings, user wants to inspect immediately

- User minimizes an alert-enabled Session into a Door.
- The Session later transitions into `ALERT_RINGING`.
- The Door rings.
- User clicks the Door.
- The Session reattaches into passthrough and the ring clears.

### Door rings, user wants to keep command-mode control

- User minimizes an alert-enabled Session into a Door.
- The Door starts ringing.
- User presses `d` on the Door in command mode.
- The Pane is restored, but the ring remains because the user has not yet explicitly attended to the Session.

### User dismisses, then new output arrives

- A Session rings.
- User clicks into the pane to read the output.
- The alert clears, and a TODO appears.
- User presses `Enter` into the Session → the `TODO` pill morphs to a `✓` and clears (they engaged).
- The Session later emits new output, progresses through `BUSY`, and eventually reaches `ALERT_RINGING` again.

### User dismisses but doesn't engage

- A Session rings.
- User clicks into the pane briefly, then switches to another session.
- The alert clears, and a TODO appears.
- User never presses `Enter` into the terminal → TODO persists.
- User later notices the TODO pill and clicks it to clear it.

## Verification checklist

- Alert only rings on a fresh transition into `ALERT_RINGING`
- Single quick responses stay in `NOTHING_TO_SHOW`
- short pauses in a `BUSY` session only reach `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION`, not `ALERT_RINGING`
- Resize noise cannot cause a ring
- Minimize/reattach preserves alert state (`status` and `todo`)
- `d` restore from a Door does not silently clear a ring
- click/`Enter` restore from a Door does clear a ring
- very long titles do not push bell or TODO indicators out of bounds
- ringing is still understandable with reduced motion enabled
- multiple simultaneous ringing Sessions remain independently dismissible

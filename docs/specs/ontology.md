# Ontology

This spec is the canonical vocabulary for states, entities, and transitions in mouseterm. Every other spec defers to this one when naming a state or a verb. When writing code or prose, pick names from here first.

## The core idea

A **Session** is the durable unit. A Session's state lives on six orthogonal axes — change one without touching the others. A caller holding a `SessionId` can reason about each axis independently.

The **Liskov contract**: a Session is substitutable across most operations regardless of which states it currently occupies. `kill` and `rename` work universally. State-gated operations (`write`, `focus`) document their preconditions in ontology terms rather than failing silently.

## Layers

| Layer | Tracks | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **Process** | PTY life on the host | `vscode-ext/src/pty-manager.ts` |
| **Registry** | xterm.js Terminal + persistent DOM element + cached Activity state | `lib/src/lib/terminal-registry.ts` facade, backed by `terminal-store.ts`, `terminal-lifecycle.ts`, and `session-activity-store.ts` |
| **View** | Where and how the session renders | `lib/src/components/Wall.tsx` plus `lib/src/components/wall/` |
| **Link** | Webview ↔ host relationship | `lib/src/lib/reconnect.ts` |
| **Activity** | Alert / attention state machine | `lib/src/lib/alert-manager.ts` |
| **Snapshot** | Persisted-to-disk projection | `lib/src/lib/session-save.ts` / `session-restore.ts` |

A **Session** is the tuple of its `SessionId` plus one state per layer. `SessionId` is immutable for the life of the Session and stable across restarts.

## States per layer

### Process

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Live` | PTY process running, receiving and emitting data |
| `Exited` | Process ended; exit buffer retained so the user can inspect the output |
| `Tombstoned` | User-killed; host refuses to resurrect even if a late `exit` event arrives |
| `Absent` | No host record at all |

### Registry

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Unregistered` | No entry in `terminal-registry` |
| `Mounted` | Entry present, persistent DOM element is in the document tree |
| `Orphaned` | Entry present, element detached from DOM — transient state during reparent or minimize |
| `Disposed` | Entry removed, xterm disposed |

### View

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Paned` | Rendered as a pane in the content area (dockview group) |
| `Zoomed` | Subset of `Paned` — the selected pane is maximized |
| `Doored` | Rendered as a door on the baseboard |
| `Hidden` | In neither — the webview itself is closed, or the session is mid-transition |

### Link

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Cold` | First load of the webview; no handshake yet |
| `Live` | Handshake complete; events flowing from host to webview |
| `Resuming` | Webview just reopened; replay drain in progress |
| `Severed` | Webview closed while host retains the processes |

### Activity

Keep the existing state machine (see `docs/specs/alert.md` for transition rules):

`ALERT_DISABLED` · `NOTHING_TO_SHOW` · `MIGHT_BE_BUSY` · `BUSY` · `MIGHT_NEED_ATTENTION` · `ALERT_RINGING`

### Snapshot

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Clean` | In-memory state matches disk |
| `Dirty` | Changes pending |
| `Flushing` | Debounced write in flight |

## Transitions

### User verbs

A user verb is an intentional action that produces a single observable change.

| Verb | Effect |
|---|---|
| `spawn` | Create a new Session (Process: Absent → Live) |
| `kill` | Request termination (Process: Live → Tombstoned, Registry: Mounted → Disposed, View: any → Hidden) |
| `minimize` | Pane → Door (View: Paned → Doored) |
| `reattach` | Door → Pane (View: Doored → Paned) |
| `rename` | Update title; layer-agnostic |
| `zoom` / `unzoom` | Paned ↔ Zoomed |
| `swap` | Exchange Registry entries across two View slots without touching Processes |

### System verbs

A system verb is a lifecycle transition driven by the runtime.

| Verb | Effect |
|---|---|
| `register` / `dispose` | Create / destroy a Registry entry |
| `mount` / `unmount` | Attach / detach the persistent DOM element from a container (low-level op; the Registry entry survives `unmount`) |
| `exit` | Host observes process death (Process: Live → Exited) |
| `resume` | Webview reopens over live PTYs (Link: Severed → Resuming → Live; Registry rebuilt from replay data; Process stays Live) |
| `restore` | Cold start from Snapshot (Link: Cold → Live; Process: Absent → Live with saved cwd; Registry rebuilt from saved scrollback) |
| `tombstone` | Host marks a Session non-recoverable |

## Liskov contract

Every Registry API declares its layer preconditions. Calls against a gated state fail with a typed error rather than silently no-op.

| Category | Valid when | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Universal** | any state combination | `kill`, `rename`, state queries |
| **View-gated** | `View ≠ Hidden` | `focus` |
| **Process-gated** | `Process = Live` | `write`, `resize` |
| **Registry-gated** | `Registry = Mounted` | `refit` |

A caller holding a `SessionId` can issue universal operations without branching. Gated operations are explicit: the caller checks the relevant layer first or catches the typed error.

## Invariants

- I1: `SessionId` is immutable for the life of a Session and stable across `resume` / `restore`.
- I2: Process state is independent of Registry, View, and Link. A `Live` process may be `Doored` or `Hidden`; an `Exited` process may still be `Paned`.
- I3: Activity state survives `minimize` / `reattach`. `ALERT_RINGING` fires only on a *fresh* transition, never on `mount` or `reattach`.
- I4: `Registry: Orphaned` is transient. Steady states are `Mounted` or `Disposed`.
- I5: `kill` is universally valid. It always terminates at (Process: Tombstoned, Registry: Disposed, View: Hidden).
- I6: `rename` is universally valid including when `Process = Exited` and `View = Doored`.

## Retired / overloaded terms

Use ontology names instead of these. The left column retains a meaning only where noted.

| Term | Status |
|---|---|
| **detach** | Retired. Previous meanings: DOM-level op → **unmount**; user-level Pane→Door → **minimize**. |
| **reconnect** | Retired. Live-PTY case → **resume**; cold start → **restore**. |
| **restore** | Keeps its meaning for cold-start rehydrate. Do not use it for Door→Pane (that is **reattach**) or for alert-manager seeding (that is **seed**). |
| **attach** | Retired at the DOM layer (was `attachTerminal`) → **mount**. User-level "reattach" (Door→Pane) keeps the `re-` prefix. |
| **session** | Keeps its meaning as the durable identity. Do not use it for the Activity projection (that is `ActivityState`, not `SessionUiState`). |
| **terminal** | Keeps its meaning for the `xterm.Terminal` instance. Prose meaning "the whole thing" is **Session**. |
| **panel / pane** | Prefer **pane**. Use "panel" only when quoting dockview's own API (`api.panels`, `addPanel`). |

## Naming conventions

- Layer names and state names are `PascalCase` nouns (`Paned`, `Tombstoned`).
- Verbs are `camelCase` in code and lowercase in prose (`minimize`, not `Minimize`).
- Event kind strings match the verb: `'minimizeChange'`, not `'detachChange'`.
- A persisted type is `Persisted<Shape>` where `<Shape>` is the ontology noun (`PersistedPane`, `PersistedDoor`).
- A handle type is `<Layer>State` (`ActivityState`, not `SessionUiState`).

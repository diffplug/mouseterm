 * `onlyIn` is what keeps a position case honest. A mutation of a name that also
 * appears at statement start proves nothing about any other anchor — the lint
 * goes red on the statement-position copies alone, which is how the missing
 * `=` hid: `Write-Host` is everywhere, so mutating it stayed red while
 * `Read-Host`, which is only ever `$reply = Read-Host '…'`, was invisible.
 * Where `onlyIn` is set, every occurrence of the name in the installer must
 * match it, so a new call in some other position re-points the case instead of
 * silently retiring it.

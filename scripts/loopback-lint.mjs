/**
 * Mechanical check for the loopback-listener invariant in `docs/specs/security-local.md`
 * ("Loopback Listeners"). Runs from the repo root via `pnpm test` (see the root
 * package.json). Exits non-zero with a per-violation report.
 *
 * Why this exists: a loopback bind is not an access control — the attacker that
 * matters is a page open in the user's own browser, which reaches `127.0.0.1`
 * as easily as our webview does, and an ephemeral port is not a secret. Two of
 * the three listeners we ship got that wrong at some point, and both were found
 * by an LLM audit rather than by CI. The audit is thorough but probabilistic;
 * this makes the cheap half of the rule deterministic, so a *fourth* listener
 * fails a build instead of waiting for the next audit to notice it.
 *
 * The check: any non-test source file that binds a TCP listener to loopback
 * must reference one of the guard modules — `lib/src/host/loopback-guard.ts`
 * for shipped code, `standalone/scripts/dev-host-guard.mjs` for the dev
 * harness — or sit on ALLOWED below with a stated reason.
 *
 * `scripts/loopback-lint-selftest.mjs` proves each bind form is load-bearing by
 * adding one and requiring this lint to go red, and goes red itself on a form in
 * BIND_FORMS it has no fixture for.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do, so nobody mistakes it for the whole rule:
 *   - It cannot tell whether the guard is actually *called* on every request,
 *     only that the file knows the guard exists. The audit still owns that.
 *   - It knows the bind forms listed at BIND_FORMS and no others. A library
 *     nobody has added yet spells its bind some way this file has never seen,
 *     so adding a server dependency means adding its spelling here.
 *   - Outside `ws`, it matches only an explicit loopback host. A listener that
 *     binds every interface (`.listen(port)` with no host) is a different and
 *     larger problem, and `relay/` does it deliberately from config, so
 *     flagging it here would be noise. A host built at runtime
 *     (`.listen(port, hostVar)`, `serve({ hostname: bindHost })`) is invisible
 *     to a regex and always will be — that is the ceiling of a textual check,
 *     and the audit is what covers above it.
 *   - Unix-domain sockets and named pipes are out of scope by design: no
 *     browser can reach one, which is why the `dor` control channel is bounded
 *     by socket permissions instead.
 *   - Test files are skipped. A fixture that stands up a loopback server is not
 *     a product listener.
 *
 * Scans `git ls-files`, not the working tree. Build output is exactly what must
 * not be scanned: `standalone/sidecar/iframe-proxy.cjs` is a bundle of the very
 * file this lint checks, so it inherits the guard reference and would pass for
 * a reason that says nothing about the source — while also making the count
 * depend on whether someone had run a build.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   1. Every matching listener references a guard module or is allowlisted.
 *   2. Every ALLOWED entry still names a real file that still matches — a stale
 *      allowlist silently exempts nothing, or worse, the next file to reuse
 *      that path.
 *   3. Finding no listeners at all is a failure, not a pass: it means the bind
 *      shape moved and this lint has quietly stopped checking anything.

// For `.listen` the host argument is what separates a TCP bind from a

// the exception: a `WebSocketServer` given a `port` binds every interface,
// loopback included, and it is the one API `docs/specs/security-local.md`'s "HTTP **and
// WebSocket**" names — so it matches on the port alone, while the `noServer`

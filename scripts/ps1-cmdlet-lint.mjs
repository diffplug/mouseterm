/**
 * Every `Verb-Noun` call in `deploy/local/install-windows.ps1` uses a verb
 * PowerShell actually approves. Runs from the repo root via `pnpm test`.
 *
 * Why this exists: nothing else reads the `.ps1`. `deploy-lint.mjs` matches
 * text, `installer-verify-test.mjs` executes the *shell* helpers, and no job
 * has a PowerShell to parse with — so the Windows installer is the one shipped
 * file with no syntax gate at all. A repo-wide rename proved the cost by
 * turning all 147 `Write-Host` calls into `Write-Burrow`: a cmdlet that does
 * not exist, in a script that only fails on the operator's machine.
 *
 * Two checks, one per half of a `Verb-Noun` name, because a rename can mangle
 * either. The verb must come from PowerShell's closed approved set
 * (`Get-Verb`), and the noun must not be one of this project's own words —
 * there is no `Write-Burrow`, and there never will be. Neither knows whether
 * `Get-Foo` exists; together they cover what a find/replace actually does to a
 * cmdlet name. A locally defined `Verb-Noun` function passes as long as its
 * verb is approved, which is the naming convention anyway.
 *
 * `scripts/ps1-cmdlet-lint-selftest.mjs` plants the defect and requires this
 * to go red.

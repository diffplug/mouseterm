# Run the nightly security audit locally, against the same prompt files CI
# uses (`.github/audit/`). Nothing is duplicated here: if this and the workflow
# ever disagree, it is a bug in one of them, not a drift in the prompts.
#
# The audit reads administration endpoints (ruleset bypass actors, secret
# listings, environment policies, `actions/permissions/workflow`). In CI those
# go through the read-only `AUDIT_PAT`; locally they go through whatever `gh`
# is already authenticated as, so run this as someone with admin read on the
# repo or the ci-and-secrets domain will report FAILs that are really 403s.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/security-audit-local.sh            # all three domains
#   scripts/security-audit-local.sh application-security   # one domain
#
# Reports land in ./audit-*.md, which .gitignore covers.

  # Opus. Local and CI must agree here, or the domain where the model matters
  # most is the one they disagree about.
  # BOTH sides are pinned, not just the strong one. Leaving the mechanical
  # domains unpinned inherits whatever the operator's `~/.claude/settings.json`
  # names, which is not necessarily weaker than Opus — on a machine defaulting
  # to `opus[1m]` it is *stronger* (same family, larger context), inverting the

  # of the nightly. CI gets this for free: its session default is Sonnet and

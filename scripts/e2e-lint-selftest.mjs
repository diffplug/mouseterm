/**
 * Proves `e2e-lint.mjs` is load-bearing: for every rule, re-introduce exactly
 * the thing it forbids and require the lint to fail.
 *
 * Why this exists: `deploy-lint-selftest.mjs` is mostly the other direction —
 * the installer lint mostly checks that controls are *present*, so removing one
 * is the test there (its one `forbidden` rule mutates this way instead). Every
 * rule here checks that something is *absent*, and the
 * characteristic failure of an absence check is passing because the pattern
 * cannot see the thing it names — a regex anchored on a spelling nobody uses, a
 * scope that resolves to no files, a spec phrase that drifted. A green
 * `e2e-lint` says nothing about any of that. "The lint goes red when each
 * forbidden thing comes back" is the property that matters, and it is checkable.
 *
 * `RULES`' own doc in `e2e-lint.mjs` states what each kind's `violation` is; a
 * `forbid` or `exactly` case appends it inside the rule's own scope, which also
 * proves that scope resolves — a `trees` rule whose filter excluded every file
 * would stay green.
 *
 * Every rule also names a line of `SECURITY_SPEC`, and the lint checks that
 * line still exists. That check is proved here too, by deleting the line: a rule
 * whose prose was removed is a rule nobody agreed to, and it must not go on
 * passing quietly. Once per *line*, not once per rule — several rules cite the
 * same sentence, and re-deleting it proves nothing new.

/**
 * Mechanical check for the structural half of the end-to-end boundary in
 * `docs/specs/security-remote.md` ("Remote Control"). Runs from the repo
 * root via `pnpm test` (see the root package.json). Exits non-zero with a
 * per-violation report naming the rule that was broken and the spec line it
 * enforces.
 *
 * Why this exists: the properties the trust boundary rests on are *absences* —
 * one Noise suite and no way to select another, no JavaScript curve, no
 * plaintext relay route, no legacy frame discriminant left to answer, no
 * Relay-side view of protocol-v1, no checked-in service worker shadowing the
 * built one. An absence is exactly what a reviewer stops noticing: nothing in a
 * diff says "a second cipher suite is now reachable", and the nightly audit is
 * thorough but probabilistic. This makes the cheap half deterministic, so
 * re-introducing any of them fails a build.
 *
 * The check is *textual* on purpose — the same ceiling `loopback-lint.mjs` and
 * `deploy-lint.mjs` state about themselves. What it deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *   - It cannot tell whether a construction is *correct*, only that a forbidden
 *     one is absent. A handshake that mixes in the wrong order, a seal that
 *     reuses a salt, or an ACL conjunction checking three fields instead of
 *     four all pass here. `remote-lib-common/test/noise.test.mjs`,
 *     `push-seal.test.mjs`, `security-guarantees.test.mjs`, and the
 *     malicious-relay harness own that, and so does the audit.
 *   - It reasons about spelled-out identifiers and string literals. A protocol
 *     name assembled at runtime, an algorithm chosen through a variable, or a
 *     dependency reached through a re-export is invisible to a regex and always
 *     will be.
 *   - Test files are out of scope for the discriminant rules on purpose:
 *     `lib/src/remote/burrow/burrow-runtime.test.ts` and
 *     `remote-lib-common/test/wire.test.mjs` name the retired tags precisely to
 *     assert they are *rejected*, and a lint that reddened on those would push
 *     someone to delete the regression tests.
 *
 * Every rule names the spec line it enforces, and that line is checked to
 * still exist — a rule whose prose was deleted is a rule nobody agreed to.
 * `scripts/e2e-lint-selftest.mjs` is what keeps the patterns honest: it
 * re-introduces each forbidden thing in turn and requires this lint to fail.

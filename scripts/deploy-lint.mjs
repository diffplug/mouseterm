/**
 * Mechanical check for the installer invariants in `docs/specs/security-remote.md`
 * ("Credentials at rest", "Network posture (self-hosted)") and SELF_HOST.md. Runs from the repo
 * root via `pnpm test` (see the root package.json). Exits non-zero with a
 * per-violation report naming the rule that was broken.
 *
 * Why this exists: those `FAIL IF` lines bind all three installers, and until
 * now nothing executed them. No workflow parses `deploy/local/`, no script
 * references it, and the installers are the one part of the tree that CI never
 * touches — so the rules were enforced entirely by whoever remembered to read
 * them. The observed cost of that is real: the macOS `manage verify` once checked
 * modes without owners while Linux checked both; the owner rules below now
 * pin the same property on all three platforms.
 *
 * The check: every installer must still contain the load-bearing control each
 * rule names. This is a *textual* check on purpose — the same ceiling
 * `loopback-lint.mjs` states about itself.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do, so nobody mistakes it for the whole rule:
 *   - It cannot tell whether a control is correct, only that it is still there.
 *     A `die` that no longer fires, or an entropy guard reading the wrong
 *     variable, passes here. The security audit still owns that.
 *   - It says nothing about the *generated* `manage` scripts beyond the fact
 *     that the installer writes the checks into them. Whether `manage verify`
 *     passes on a real install is what `manage verify` is for. The decisions
 *     that turn on searching unbounded CLI output are executed rather than
 *     read: `scripts/installer-verify-test.mjs` extracts those functions from
 *     these files and drives them, because each once matched the right string
 *     and returned the wrong answer.
 *   - Windows is checked at the same depth as the other two, which is worth
 *     stating plainly: nothing in CI can execute PowerShell here, so for that
 *     file this lint is the *only* automated signal that a control survives.
 *
 * Adding an installer means adding it to INSTALLERS. A rule that genuinely does
 * not apply to a platform belongs in `skip` with a reason, not silently
 * omitted — an unexplained gap is how the owner-check divergence happened.

 * elsewhere in the file. A review found three rules satisfied by an unrelated
 * occurrence: `\b64\b` matched two `exit 64` lines and the entropy guard's own
 * explanatory comment, so the prose about the rule survived deleting the rule.
 * `scripts/deploy-lint-selftest.mjs` is what keeps that honest: it removes each
 * matched control in turn and requires this lint to fail.
 *
 * `forbidden` inverts the rule: the pattern must match NOTHING, for a `FAIL IF`
 * that names a thing an installer must not do. Anchored on the act the spec
 * forbids rather than on the subject, so prose explaining why the thing is
 * absent is not itself the violation, and paired with `violation` or
 * platform-specific `violations` — the text `deploy-lint-selftest.mjs`
 * appends to prove every forbidden shape is checked rather than merely absent.
 * `exactMatches` is meaningless beside it and is refused.
 *
 * `exactMatches` is for a control the installer writes at several sites on
 * purpose — in its own body and into the generated `manage` — where matching
 * only one would let the others be deleted silently. Setting it is a claim that
 * *these are all the sites*, and the comparison is exact in both directions:
 * fewer matches means a control went missing, more means a site was added and
 * the count must be bumped deliberately in the same commit. Rules without it
 * require at least one match.

    // `exactMatches` is doing the real work here, and it has to be set for
    // every platform. Each writes the conjunct at more than one site, and a
    // pattern that matched only one left the others deletable: on macOS the
    // first version matched the generated `manage`'s wait and left the
    // post-switch wait — the one whose failure rolls back and dies — unlinted.
    // Counting is what makes "every copy survives" checkable; the self-test
    // cannot see it, because it proves the *matched* text is load-bearing,
    // never that every copy of the control is matched. The count was once a
    // floor, which meant a legitimately-added site silently re-armed the same
    // gap: the new site could later lose its identity conjunct without the
    // count dropping below the floor. Exact is what forces the bump.
    //
    // The counts, and where they come from:
    //   macOS   3 — `manage`'s wait_for_health, the post-switch wait, the
    //               rollback wait
    //   Linux   2 — `service_healthy`, once in the body and once in `manage`
    //   Windows 4 — post-switch, Restore-PreviousRelease, `manage rollback`, `manage verify`
    // Windows names its comparison four different ways, so the pattern matches
    // the shape (an identity variable against an expected release) rather than
    // one spelling.
    //
    // Every macOS comparison counted here calls `listening_release` inline, so
    // no match can be held up by a spelling that never consults it. `manage
    // verify` is the one macOS site that cannot be written that way — it needs
    // the answer twice, once for the gate and once for the failure message that
    // names the release — so it assigns `serving` first, and the rule below
    // covers it. Folding it in here instead, by accepting a bare
    // `[ "$serving" = "$x" ]` as a second spelling, looked free and was not:
    // that alternative is bound to nothing, so any of the sites above could be
    // rewritten into it — including the post-switch wait — and the count would
    // still read 4. Only `=` is counted; the `!=` uses at `install-macos.sh`
    // :675 and :1195 are post-failure diagnostics, reports rather than gates.

    // All three parts are needed, which is why the pattern is an alternation
    // with an exact count of 3 rather than one pattern per part. A comparison
    // is only as good as both of its operands, so each is pinned to the thing
    // that has to have produced it: `serving` to `listening_release`, `cur_id`
    // to the `current` symlink. Editing any of the three parts drops the count
    // to 2 — deleting the comparison leaves the two lookups; rewriting
    // `serving="$cur_id"` leaves the comparison and the expected release;
    // rewriting `cur_id="$serving"` compares the port's holder to itself, so
    // `verify` green-ticks whatever answers. That last one is the same shape as
    // the first, on the other operand, and it stayed green until the count
    // reached 3. Matching the parts in one span instead would need a
    // `[\s\S]*?` gap between them, which the self-test cannot check honestly —
    // it deletes the matched text verbatim, so a match swallowing the lines
    // between would turn the lint red for the wrong reason and the self-test
    // could not tell.

    // `cur_id=` prefix anchors the symlink read — the file's three other
    // `basename readlink current` reads assign `want` or print inline.
    //
    // The other three macOS sites the rule above counts still bind only their
    // *served* operand: `want`, `old_id`, and `$RELEASE_ID` can each be
    // rewritten to whatever `listening_release` returned with the lint green.
    // Same for Windows's four. Closing that class is a wider change than this
    // site, and is left open deliberately — the analysis is in #482.

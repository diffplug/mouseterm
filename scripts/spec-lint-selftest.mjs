/**
 * Proves the finding checks in `spec-lint.mjs` are load-bearing: plant one
 * defect per check in a real, tracked file and require the lint to go red.
 *
 * A finding check's characteristic failure is passing because its pattern no
 * longer matches what somebody wrote — a `(rationale)` marker spelled a new
 * way, a citation in a form the regex cannot see. A green run says nothing
 * about that; a planted defect that stays green does.
 *
 * The spec the cases plant into is chosen at run time: one with a rationale
 * file, no `## Future` (a planted heading must not land after the fold), and
 * the most room under its word budget, so a case cannot go red for the budget
 * instead of for its check. Check 15 (a large spec needs a rationale file) is
 * a number, not a pattern, and cannot be planted without also tripping the
 * structural checks, so it is not here. `scripts/lint-kit.mjs` owns the
 * edit-and-restore. Valid-form cases also keep optional navigation maps
 * compatible with targeted implementation pointers.

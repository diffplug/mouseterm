/**
 * Production assertions on the built Pocket app — the last step of
 * `build:pocket`, so an output that would fail on a phone fails here instead.
 * Two rules, each defending a claim made elsewhere that the bundler could break
 * silently:
 *
 * * **The worker** (`docs/specs/pocket-app.md` -> Installable web app).
 *   `registerPushServiceWorker` registers `/sw.js` classic, with no
 *   `type: 'module'`, from the scope root. A worker carrying module syntax, a
 *   dynamic-import loader, or a sibling chunk installs on nothing — and the
 *   failure is invisible from the desktop, because push is the one feature no
 *   developer machine exercises.
 * * **The shell** (`docs/specs/pocket-app.md` -> Deployment). The origin is
 *   served `script-src 'self'` with no nonce pipeline, which is only safe while
 *   the shell carries no inline script and loads nothing off-origin. Vite emits
 *   an inline module-preload polyfill for some builds, so this reads the real
 *   output rather than the source shell — and it lives here, in the build,
 *   because no test suite builds the app first.
 *
 * Pure so `lib/src/remote/pocket-app/assert-pocket-worker.test.ts` can drive
 * both against fixtures; the CLI at the bottom is the build's entry point.

/**
 * Host-agnostic transparent proxy for the iframe surface
 * (docs/specs/dor-browser.md → "Iframe Renderer").
 *
 * Instead of pointing the `<iframe>` at a `dor iframe <url>` target directly —
 * where a cross-origin frame owns the keyboard, hides load errors, and can be
 * refused outright — the panel points it at a loopback proxy this module stands
 * up. Once Dormouse serves the bytes it can: (1) inject a fixed shim that
 * forwards the reserved leader chord back to the Wall, and (2) see the upstream
 * result and render a precise error *page* instead of a blank pane.
 *
 * This is the shared Node server, consumed by both hosts that can run one — the
 * VS Code extension host (`vscode-ext/src/iframe-proxy-host.ts`) and the Tauri
 * sidecar (bundled in via `standalone/scripts/build-sidecar-proxy.mjs`). Only
 * the policy/rewriting logic lives in `./iframe-proxy-rewrite` (pure, tested);
 * this file is the `http`/`net` plumbing. The logger is injected so neither host
 * has to depend on the other's logging.
 *
 * Sibling to the agent-browser stream relay: same loopback-only bind and
 * per-surface isolation, but this one speaks HTTP (parses and rewrites
 * responses) and passes WebSocket upgrades through (dev-server HMR,
 * openvscode-server).
 *
 * Per-surface isolation, two deliberate notes vs the spec's sketch:
 *   - Each grant gets its OWN ephemeral loopback server, so the grant's *origin*
 *     is the grant. That makes root-relative sub-resources (`/assets/x.js`) and
 *     absolute paths resolve and proxy transparently with zero body rewriting.
 *     A server bound to exactly one upstream is inherently not an open forwarder.
 *   - No token in the URL. It would land in `location.pathname` and break
 *     client-side routers (a React-Router/Remix dev server reads the path,
 *     matches no route, and renders its own 404), and it would not survive onto
 *     root-relative sub-resource requests at all. The dedicated server and the
 *     loopback bind are mitigations, **not** the boundary — the port is
 *     discoverable in seconds.
 *
 * The boundary is three checks, and which one applies depends on what is being
 * asked for (`./loopback-guard.ts`, `docs/specs/security-local.md` → "Loopback Listeners"):
 *   - `Host` names this grant's own port, so DNS rebinding fails. Both paths.
 *   - `Origin` is this grant's own before the proxy will relabel it as the
 *     upstream's. Vouching for a stranger is what turns a transparent proxy
 *     into a CSRF amplifier; a foreign origin is forwarded, not blocked, so the
 *     upstream applies its own policy. Both paths.
 *   - The **embedder chain** — who may frame this proxy at all — governs the
 *     two privileges a request header cannot: taking the upstream's framing
 *     controls away, and injecting a shim that reads the framed page's URLs
 *     back out. Neither is per-request (an iframe navigation carries no
 *     `Origin`, and `Sec-Fetch-Site` says `cross-site` for our own webview and
 *     for an attacker page alike), so both are conditioned on a
 *     `frame-ancestors` allowing only the grant's own origin (for nested frames)
 *     and the app's validated chain, which the browser enforces. With no chain
 *     the proxy takes nothing away and injects nothing, which leaves a caller
 *     exactly what the upstream would have given it directly.

 * redeems through `DORMOUSE_ENROLL_TOKEN_FILE`, shape and guard shared in
 * `remote-lib-common/src/remote/enroll-offer.ts`. There is no handshake between
 * the two processes: both simply know where the installer puts it.
 *
 * Freshness is shared with the Relay. This process reads the file from the
 * same machine that stamped it, so an expired offer disappears from Settings
 * instead of leading with a button the Relay can only reject.

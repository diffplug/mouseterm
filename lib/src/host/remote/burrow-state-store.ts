/**
 * Where a Node-resident Burrow keeps the two things it must survive a restart
 * with: the enrollment (which carries `burrowToken`, a bearer credential) and the
 * ACL (the authorization primitive, which per the security model lives on the
 * Burrow and nowhere else — docs/specs/remote-security-model.md).
 *
 * The interface is async because the hosts that implement it are: a file the
 * sidecar owns here, `VsCodeBurrowStateStore` there (enrollment in
 * `SecretStorage`, ACL in `globalState` — `docs/specs/vscode.md`). {@link FileBurrowStateStore}
 * is the sidecar's: one file, 0600, under a directory the app passes in.

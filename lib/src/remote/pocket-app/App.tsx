/**
 * Dormouse Pocket — the phone-side app (docs/specs/pocket-app.md).

 * Auth screens over {@link PocketClient} — scan a computer's code (or sign in,

 * on a successful connect, the real mobile experience: a {@link RemotePtyAdapter}
 * over the session drives `MobileTerminalUi`/`MobileWall` (the same composition
 * the website playground proves out with `FakePtyAdapter`). No bespoke terminal
 * UI.
 *
 * The whole shell — auth screens included — renders on the shared `--vscode-*`
 * design tokens, restored to <body> before first paint by restorePocketTheme()
 * in main.tsx. Chrome draws only on the three list pairs — see

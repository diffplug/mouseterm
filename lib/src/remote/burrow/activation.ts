/**
 * Activation glue: wires this webview to the Burrow service behind the
 * platform adapter, and exposes a `window.dormouseBurrow` console hook for
 * enrolling in the POC (no settings UI needed).
 *
 * The Burrow itself is a service in the process that owns the PTYs
 * (`lib/src/host/remote/service.ts`) — the Tauri sidecar, the VS Code extension
 * host. This module is its client: it forwards console commands, mirrors the
 * pairing queue, and reports rings. It starts no Burrow, holds no relay socket,
 * and reads no ACL. A host with no service behind it (the website) gets nothing
 * at all, which is why every entry point here tolerates a missing link.
 *
 * Enroll from the devtools console:
 *
 *   await window.dormouseBurrow.enroll('https://your-relay', 'SETUP_PASSWORD', 'My Laptop')
 *   await window.dormouseBurrow.enrollOffer('https://your-relay', 'My Laptop')  // installer's offer, this machine
 *   window.dormouseBurrow.status()
 *   window.dormouseBurrow.reconnect()      // needed after `displaced`
 *   window.dormouseBurrow.clearEnrollment()

 * Push notifications for unattended alarms (`docs/specs/alert.md` -> Push

 * send that Pane's name to the paired phones.
 *
 * The ring detection, delay, and cancellation rules are shared with spoken
 * alarms (`lib/src/lib/alert-ring-watch.ts`); this module is the webview half of
 * the push sink — the watch, the pane label, and the settings dialog's device
 * list. The Relay calls themselves are in `push-delivery.ts`, which a
 * Node-resident Burrow runs without any of this.
 *
 * It lives under `remote/burrow/` rather than `lib/` because it is only meaningful
 * with a Burrow behind it, and because that keeps it inside the lazily-imported
 * `RemotePairingModalHost` chunk — so a host that never sets `enableBurrow`
 * never fetches it.

 * module holds no Burrow, no relay socket and no ACL — it asks and mirrors.

 * lazily-loaded pairing-modal chunk, while Settings is in the main one. Both
 * subscribe to the same service events, and `link.on` supports either arriving
 * first, so the dialog works whether or not the pairing chunk has loaded.
 *
 * The service's `status` event carries only `{ enrolled }`
 * (`service-protocol.ts` -> `BurrowStatusEvent`), which is enough to know the
 * answer changed but not what it changed to — so every event re-reads the full
 * status rather than patching a field.

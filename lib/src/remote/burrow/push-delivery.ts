/**
 * Delivering a push (`docs/specs/alert.md` -> Push notifications): what the Burrow
 * posts, and the rule that the Burrow's own ACL — read at send time — chooses who
 * is reached. The transport those calls run under is `burrow-fetch.ts`, shared
 * with the setup-token mint.
 *
 * Split from `alert-push.ts` because the two halves run in different processes
 * once the Burrow is Node-resident: ring *detection* is webview state (the
 * activity store, the alarm settings, the pane's label), while *delivery* needs
 * the enrollment and the ACL, which only the Burrow holds. Nothing here touches
 * the DOM or a store, so it runs unchanged in a webview or in the sidecar.
 *
 * Delivery is an HTTP POST to the Relay rather than a relay frame: the relay
 * routes between two live sockets, and the whole point of a push is reaching a
 * phone whose app is closed.

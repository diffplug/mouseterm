/**
 * The pairing-approval queue: an external store (same shape as
 * `external-link-confirmation.ts`) that backs the React approval modal.
 *
 * The ceremony itself runs in the Burrow service, which is where the ACL is
 * (`lib/src/host/remote/service.ts`). This is the webview's mirror of its
 * queue: the service pushes a snapshot, `activation.ts` projects it here, and
 * `approve`/`deny` send a command back keyed by both `clientId` and the
 * immutable `pairingId` the modal displayed — so the closures that can
 * actually write the ACL never leave that process, and a stale modal cannot
 * answer a replacement request under the same client id.
 *
 * **The expected two-digit code is not here and cannot be.** The webview echoes
 * the digits a person typed; the Burrow compares them. A mirrored code would make
 * the confirmation a formality any webview-side attacker could satisfy
 * (`docs/specs/remote-security-model.md` → Pairing).

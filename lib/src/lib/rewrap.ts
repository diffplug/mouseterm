/**
 * Copy Rewrapped heuristics. Two transformations per spec §4.1.2:
 *
 *  1. Unwrap hard newlines that look like display wrapping inside a flowing
 *     paragraph. Blank lines stay as paragraph separators.
 *  2. Strip runs of Unicode box-drawing characters that form UI chrome
 *     (frames, table borders), keeping the text they surround.
 *
 * The rules are deliberately simple first-cut heuristics — see the
 * mouse-and-clipboard spec §9.1 (Out of Scope) for the follow-up to refine
 * them based on dogfooding.

/**
 * The webview end of the `dor` control transport, shared by every adapter that
 * receives control requests (Tauri, the browser sidecar, VS Code). Each host
 * carries the same three events over its own wire — `dor:controlRequest`,
 * `dor:controlResponse`, `dor:controlCancel` — and needs the same bookkeeping on
 * this side, so it lives here once instead of three times.
 *
 * A control request can outlive the client that made it: a parked `dor await`
 * blocks for minutes, and its client can time out or be Ctrl-C'd at any point.
 * The control server sends `dor:controlCancel` when that happens (or when its
 * own deadline fires), and the handler learns about it through the request's
 * `AbortSignal` — its cue to release whatever it armed, since nothing it
 * responds with can reach the client any more.
 *
 * Source of truth for the wire shapes: `dor/src/protocol.ts`.

 * to the handler clears the bookkeeping first, so answering a request is also

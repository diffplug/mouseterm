 * deviceScaleFactor), so the panel paints it provisionally for responsiveness
 * and uses this loop to replace it with device-resolution host screenshots.
 *
 * Backpressure (we only ever want the latest, and must slow down if capture
 * can't keep up): at most one screenshot in flight; a pulse during a shot sets
 * `dirty` (no queue — bursts collapse to one follow-up, latest wins); the next
 * shot won't start until at least one shot-duration (adaptive EWMA) has passed
 * since the last one began, so a slow capture self-throttles. A static page
 * produces no pulses, so no shots and no cost.
 *
 * While the panel is painting provisional stream frames, a shot can't win the race
 * anyway (`getProvisionalDeadline`), so the loop waits the window out and takes one
 * settled shot at its end rather than one per pulse. Whatever the loop drops — a
 * deferred shot or one superseded mid-flight — it stays `dirty`, because the canvas
 * is left on a CSS-resolution frame and only a later crisp shot can sharpen it.

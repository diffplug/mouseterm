 * NOT do is confer access — it is a delivery address the Burrow may choose to
 * write to, and the Burrow's ACL remains the only thing that decides what a
 * Client may reach (docs/specs/remote-security-model.md). The authorization for
 * a subscription row is possession of the `deliveryId` the Burrow minted at
 * pairing, so nothing here signs anything.

 * the browser still reports a perfectly valid subscription. Comparing digests
 * catches that; the Client stores this rather than the endpoint so a bearer
 * capability is not copied into `localStorage` to answer a yes/no question.
 *
 * Not a security boundary — it is a change detector, and a device comparing it

 * Shared by the Burrow (which builds the payload from a Pane label, before
 * sealing it) and the Pocket service worker (which re-bounds at the render
 * sink), so the rule has one implementation across both runtimes rather than a
 * strong copy and a weak one. The Relay is not one of them: it forwards
 * ciphertext (`docs/specs/remote-security-model.md` -> Push sealing).
 *
 * The label is ultimately terminal-supplied — `OSC 0`/`2`/`9` titles reach the
 * Pane label (`docs/specs/alert.md` -> Text And Security) — so beyond bounding
 * the length this strips control characters and the Unicode bidi and
 * zero-width format characters, which can visually reorder or hide text on a
 * lock screen.
 *
 * Note this deliberately keeps angle brackets. Stripping those is a
 * speech-engine rule (`toSpokenText`), where WebKit wedges on them; a
 * notification renders plain text and a title like `<idle>` should survive.

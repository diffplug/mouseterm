 * used to be `localStorage`, whose SQLite WAL grew unbounded. This replaces it
 * with an in-memory cache seeded once at boot from the Rust file store, with
 * writes forwarded asynchronously to Rust.
 *
 * `getState()` stays synchronous (cold-start restore reads it before React
 * mounts): reads hit the cache, and the cache is hydrated in `init()` — which
 * `bootstrap()` awaits before restore — mirroring how the VS Code adapter reads
 * a host-injected seed.
 *
 * Writes coalesce: at most one `save_session` is in flight; if `setItem` fires
 * again mid-save, only the latest value is written when the current one settles,
 * so a burst of saves collapses to two Rust round-trips, not N.

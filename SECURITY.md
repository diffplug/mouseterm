# Security policy

**Report a vulnerability privately** through GitHub's
[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/diffplug/dormouse/security/advisories/new)
form. It opens an advisory visible only to you and the maintainers. Do not open
a public issue, and do not email the maintainer: a public issue describing a
live path into a laptop is a disclosure, not a report. Include the version or
commit, the deployment (self-hosted Relay, standalone app, VS Code extension),
and the shortest reproduction. Every advisory is acknowledged with what we
intend to do about it; there is no bounty.

**What Dormouse guarantees, what it does not, and how that is checked** is the
security spec, [`docs/specs/security.md`](docs/specs/security.md), published at
<https://dormouse.sh/docs/security> — whole, but with the guarantees table and
the two lists narrowed there to that page's audience, so the spec itself is
where every row appears together. It names the five audited
checklists beside it — [local](docs/specs/security-local.md),
[remote control](docs/specs/security-remote.md),
[supply chain](docs/specs/security-supply-chain.md),
[CI and releases](docs/specs/security-ci.md), and
[the audit itself](docs/specs/security-audit.md) — whose `FAIL IF` lines a
nightly audit executes and every VS Code release is gated on. A failure files a
public issue labeled
[`security-audit-failure`](https://github.com/diffplug/dormouse/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity-audit-failure);
open ones are live, closed ones are the record.

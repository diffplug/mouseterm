 * Spawn an external binary and capture its stdout/stderr — the single home for
 * the hard-won Windows recipe `dor` and the agent-browser host both need. See
 * docs/specs/dor-cli.md → "Spawning External Binaries".
 *
 *  - cross-spawn resolves PATHEXT and routes `.cmd`/`.bat` through cmd.exe; Node's
 *    own spawn ENOENTs on a bare name and (>=22) EINVALs on a `.cmd` by full path.
 *  - windowsHide stops a console window flashing and stealing focus per spawn.
 *  - resolve on 'exit' (not 'close') with a grace + an exit-time output snapshot:
 *    `agent-browser open` leaves a daemon that on Windows inherits our stdio
 *    pipes, so 'close' never fires (waiting on it alone hangs forever) and the
 *    daemon's post-exit scribbles would otherwise leak into the captured output.
 *
 * Never throws: a spawn-level failure resolves as `{ ok: false, error }`.

# canopy

Experimental lab for 3D/WebXR terminal rendering. Not part of the production
build — just Storybook stories exercising `@diffplug/xterm-addon-webgl-sdf`,
the webgl addon from our [xterm.js fork](https://github.com/diffplug/xterm.js)
(`sdf` branch — read its `FORK.md` for branch strategy and release process).

```sh
pnpm dev:canopy   # storybook on http://localhost:6007
```

## Dependency rules

- The addon is consumed as a **GitHub-release tarball URL** (no npm registry,
  no auth). pnpm records an integrity hash in the lockfile.
- The addon bundles xterm core internals, so `@xterm/xterm` here must be the
  exact beta the fork release was built from. Two things record that base: the
  release version encodes its counter (`0.20.0-sdf304.0` ⇒ built from
  `@xterm/xterm@6.1.0-beta.304`), and — as of `0.20.0-sdf301.1` — the tarball
  declares `peerDependencies: { "@xterm/xterm": "^6.1.0-beta.304" }`, the way
  every upstream addon does. The peer range is the authoritative one: it names
  the full version, whereas the counter in the tag repeats across upstream
  release lines.
- Renovate cannot see tarball URLs, and `.github/renovate.json` disables
  `@xterm/**` for this file so it cannot drift the two pins off the fork base
  either. Bumps are manual: cut a fork release, then
  `node scripts/xterm-bump.mjs --canopy <forkVersion>` from the repo root
  rewrites the URL and both pins together. `scripts/xterm-lint.mjs` (in
  `pnpm test`) fails if the fork's declared peer range and the `@xterm/xterm`
  pin ever disagree. The trigger and the review process are in
  `docs/specs/webgl-text.md`; the fork-side recipe is in FORK.md on the `sdf`
  branch.

## Regression harness

The `UpstreamVsFork` story renders identical content through three renderers
stacked: pristine upstream `@xterm/addon-webgl`, the fork with `sdf: false`
(isolates the instance-layout/shader changes), and the fork with `sdf: true`
(isolates the SDF glyph path). The upstream pin must be the same commit as the
fork base — the `@xterm/*` beta counters are independent, so the numbers never
match (addon `0.20.0-beta.300` == core `6.1.0-beta.304` == commit `c58ea363`);
re-derive it with `npm view @xterm/addon-webgl@<ver> gitHead` when the fork
rebases, or let `node scripts/xterm-bump.mjs --canopy <forkVersion>` pick the
matching addon.

Story content writes PUA glyphs (powerline chevrons etc.) as `\uE0BX` escapes,
never literal characters — the literals are invisible in editors and were once
silently dropped in a file rewrite, which presented as a rendering regression.

## Local dev loop against the fork

```sh
# in ~/projects/xterm.js:  npm run dev  (or build+package for a one-shot)
cd canopy && pnpm link ~/projects/xterm.js/addons/addon-webgl
```

CAUTION: pnpm 11's link also writes persistent residue — a `link:` dependency in
the ROOT `package.json` and an `overrides:` entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` —
which silently keeps resolving the link. Revert both and `pnpm install` before
trusting a tarball verification.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Consume the stock webgl addon through the fork pipeline~~ (done — the
   stories render via WebGL2 with the pixel-accurate texture atlas)
2. ~~Swap the glyph atlas to signed distance fields~~ (done — vendored
   mapbox/tiny-sdf behind the addon's `sdf` / `sdfGlyphSize` options; hybrid
   atlas keeps emoji, box/powerline custom glyphs and decorated cells on the
   raster path. `SdfVsRasterAt3x` renders a low-res SDF atlas crisp at 3x;
   `SdfTextureAtlas` shows the live distance fields. Known v1 limits:
   decorated cells fall back to raster, and single-channel SDF rounds very
   sharp corners at extreme magnification — MSDF is the upgrade path.)
3. Render terminals as textures in a WebXR scene.
